Welcome to the first task of the **"Perl Weekly Challenge"** event. Every Monday, we are going to propose 2 challenges, one aimed at Beginners and another for Experts. However you are free to choose the challenge you fancy. You can even attempt to solve both. As you know the choice of languages are Perl5 and Perl6. You can solve one challenge in Perl5 and other in Perl6, if you like. Please send us your solution by 6pm (UK time) Sunday 31 March 2019. The winner will be declared in the weekly blog the very next day.

### Challenge #1
> Write a script to replace the character **'e'** in the string **'Perl Weekly Challenge'**. Also print the number of times the character **'e'** found in the string.

### Challenge #2
> Write one-liner to solve **FizzBuzz** problem and print number 1-20. However, any number divisible by **3** should be replaced by the word fizz and any divisible by **5** by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by **both** become fizz buzz.

This challenge was proposed by **@oneandoneis2** as DM on Twitter.
