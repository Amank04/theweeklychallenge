Welcome to the first task of the **"Perl Weekly Challenge"** event. Every Monday, we are going to propose 2 challenges, one aimed at Beginners and another for Experts. However you are free to choose the challenge you fancy. You can even attempt to solve both. As you know the choice of languages are Perl5 and Perl6. You can solve one challenge in Perl5 and other in Perl6, if you like.

### Challenge #1
> Write a script to replace the character **'e'** with **'E'** in the string **'Perl Weekly Challenge'**. Also print the number of times the character **'e'** is found in the string.

### Challenge #2
> Write a one-liner to solve the **FizzBuzz** problem and print the numbers 1 through 20. However, any number divisible by **3** should be replaced by the word 'fizz' and any divisible by **5** by the word 'buzz'. Those numbers that are both divisible by **3** and **5** become 'fizzbuzz'.

This challenge was proposed by **@oneandoneis2** as DM on Twitter. Last date to submit the solution **6 pm (UK Time) Sunday 31st March 2019**.
