## Merry Christmas

Finally we reached to the end of `Advent Calendar`. It was a hectic `24 days`. Not an easy task to manage/run the `Advent Calendar`. I would to take this opportunity to thank each and every contributors. Please accept my apology if I missed anyone. I tried to give equal opportunity to those who blog about their contributions.

As you all know, I hardly blog about my contributions. I even stopped taking part in the weekly challenge during the `Advent Calendar` period. Too much to handle and too less time in hand. Last time, I blogged about my contribution was in the [**Week 081**](/blog/weekly-challenge-081) on `Mon, Oct 12, 2020`. It is something I would like to get back to in the new year.

It is not that I haven't blogged at all. Below is the list that I can compile.

I was supposed to contribute to [**Perl Advent Calendar 2022**](https://perladvent.org/2022) and [**Raku Advent Calendar 2022**](https://raku-advent.blog/category/2022). As it turned out, I could only get the article ready in the last minute. Thanks to the dear friend, `JJ Merelo`, I made it in the end. You can checkout the post, [**Raku and I**](https://raku-advent.blog/2022/12/21/day-21-raku-and-i-journey-begin).

With the regard to my contribution to `Perl Advent Calendar 2022`, it was too late to find a slot, unfortunately. You can still checkout my post, [**App::Timer**](/blog/app-timer).
