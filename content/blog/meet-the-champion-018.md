Welcome to the weekly series **"Meet The Champion"**.

Last week we spoke to **Yozen Hernandez**, the winner of **[Perl Weekly Challenge - 017](/blog/meet-the-champion-017)**. Today we are talking to the **[Perl Weekly Challenge - 018](/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-018)** winner **E. Choroba**. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Choroba:** Both my parents were mathematicians. Despite the iron curtain (I'm from the Czech Republic) and technological embargo of the Eastern block in the 80's, my father was able to get a Commodore computer for me, so I started with Basic and Assembler at the age of 13. Later, I majored in logic and got a PhD in mathematical linguistics. After a postdoc project at university, I left academia for private sector; I've worked for a large investment bank and a mid-sized business intelligence company, using Perl as the main tool.

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using **Perl**/**Raku**?

**Choroba:** I started using Perl at university in the late 90's. We used it for natural language processing, later I even taught it to graduates. I installed Rakudo when it was officially released for the first time, but haven't used it beyond occasional experiments since.

***

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Choroba:** I don't remember anymore. I read Twitter, Reddit, I'm on PerlMonks and several IRC channels, I subscribe to Perl Weekly.

***

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Choroba:** Unlike most of the programming competitions and learnings sites, the PWC doesn't always come with a clean specification. There are many things left out, many questions left open. But in this case, it's good, it gives us freedom to discuss possible solutions, to show the proverbial *more than one way*.

***

**Mohammad:** Is there any thing you would like to change?

**Choroba:** I'd love to have more time, but I fear the organisers can't help me with that at all.

***

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Choroba:** Usually, it takes me about ten minutes to half and hour to find solutions. Writing a blog post takes an hour or two, as English isn't my first language. But the first task in #018, the suffix trees, took several hours to implement, and several more to blog about, so winning exactly in this round was a great satisfaction!

***

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favourite?

**Choroba:** I don't check all of them, as there are too many lately! I read the recaps and reviews regularly (once I finish my own), and if something captures my attention, I usually follow the link and read more of the author. Naming one participant would be unfair to the others... probably with the exception of Damian Conway. I admire his presentation and writing style and I like both the depth and breadth of his solutions.

***

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started the weekly challenge?

**Choroba:** Have fun. Use CPAN, use Wikipedia. The goal isn't to be perfect, but to learn and share the knowledge.

***

**Mohammad:** Do you find the website user friendly? What do you like most?

**Choroba:** Yes, I like sites with simple design. I especially love to play with the charts.

***

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would like share with us?

**Choroba:** I like the Perl community and I'm glad I can give something back to it. Thank you, Mohammad, for organising the challenge and giving us opportunity to share and learn.

That brings the end of the conversation with **E. Choroba**. Please do let us know your view. We will come back next week with another champion.
