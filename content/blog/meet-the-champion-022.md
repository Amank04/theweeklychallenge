Welcome to the weekly series **"Meet The Champion"**.

Last week we spoke to **Ruben Westerberg**, the winner of **[Perl Weekly Challenge - 021](/blog/meet-the-champion-021)**. Today we are talking to the **[Perl Weekly Challenge - 022](/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-022)** winner **Kian-Meng Ang**. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

***
***

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Kian-Meng:** Nothing fancy, just a regular LAMP stack web developer. You probably can get more details from my [personal blog](https://www.kianmeng.org).

***

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using **Perl5**/**Perl6**?

**Kian-Meng:** Since April 2016, when I was switching away from doing PHP to something else and in an unforeseen coincident, ended up as a web developer doing Perl.

***

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Kian-Meng:** Can't recall, most likely from [Perl Weekly Newsletter](http://perlweekly.com/).

***

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Kian-Meng:** I do enjoy [code reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Reading) and PWC allows me to read and review different solutions by numerous participants from various backgrounds. It allows me to tap into the knowledge, ideas, and coding styles of these participants. Furthermore, I can write more to improve my writing skill.

***

**Mohammad:** Is there any thing you would like to change?

**Kian-Meng:** More challenges that can show case certain features of Perl programming language itself or CPAN modules, be it Perl 5 or Perl 6.

***

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Kian-Meng:** 6 to 8 hours, mostly on writing weekly review rather than the challenge.

***

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favourite?

**Kian-Meng:** Yeah but mostly on Perl 5 solutions since I'm writing a weekly review for each challenge. No particular favourite but solutions by participants who have been mentioned (you know who you are) in the weekly review are worth looking into.

***

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started the weekly challenge?

**Kian-Meng:** Just start. Pick a task, solve it, and submit your answer. Do it every week.

***

**Mohammad:** Do you find the website user friendly? What do you like most?

**Kian-Meng:** Generally, looks good on desktop but drop down menu seems broken on mobile devices.

***

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like share with us?

**Kian-Meng:** Nope, I'm good.

***

That brings the end of the conversation with **Kian-Meng Ang**. Please do let us know your view. We will come back next week with another champion.
