Welcome to the weekly series **"Meet The Champion"**.

Last week we spoke to **Athanasius**, the winner of **[Perl Weekly Challenge - 023](/blog/meet-the-champion-023)**. Today we are talking to the **[Perl Weekly Challenge - 024](/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-024)** winner **Lubos Kolouch**. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Lubos:** I started coding when I was 10 - at that time using a smart calculator :). My first real code was written in **BASIC**, **Z80 assembler** and then in **Turbo Pascal**.

After graduating I started back in 2001 working for a major US consulting company. My first projects were building virtual marketplace in **Java** and then doing some integration work.

Afterwards, working at a major Japanese mobile phone manufacturer, I happily used **Perl** to build tools like market repairs analysis, payment and quality website. It continued to amaze me how few hundreds of **Perl** code can easily replace many days of manual work.

I continued to work on more and more interesting projects - for example my **Perl** code still continues to process messages from a car factory, enabling the translation, visualization, processing and finally payment of Just In Sequence deliveries to the production line. I had unbelievable fun with **Perl** - with every little **Kaizen** project to improve the solution - for example displaying images of the wheels to be delivered to the line workers. By necessity I also wrote complete HR reporting and analysis tool that the HR SW vendor was not willing or able to do.

I am now responsible to lead IT for EMEA part of a global company and I don't have time to code as much as I would like to. I genuinely miss it and I am grateful for projects like **"Perl Weekly Challenge"** to keep my skills fresh. On one hand it is great that cloud technologies are making IT more simple and easier to deploy, on the other hand I am afraid it will drive people away from the fun part of IT - solving (business) problems and delivering solutions.

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using **Perl**/**Raku**?

**Lubos:** I learned Perl back in **1999/2000** when I started to learn **Linux**. I needed to automate some parts of the deployment and also - I admit it was not so honest - to help me play an online game (I had a bug in the script and they caught me and banned me by the way).

I had already some **Java** experience and I was amazed by **Perl**. Finally I felt I was coding the same way I was talking (programming language following the way I was thinking). It was so great relief compared to **"gluing classes and methods"** like I was doing in **Java**.

The coding speed amazed me and the more I have written in **Perl**, the more the language had me. Learning about the **Schwartzian** transformation was like from another planet.

Then I discovered **CPAN** and I felt like in paradise.

**Perl** has been my go-to language since then for every project.

Unfortunately something happened in the recent years and I am not sure this will still be the case. I think that the **Perl6** naming was really unfortunate and the **"Perl Leadership"** focused on wrong things.

It seems to me that the **Perl 6** name brought unfortunately only confusion. First of all, it might have caused many projects to switch - first - to **"let's wait for the new Perl version"** - and then - **"let's move to another language until P6 is delivered"**.

**Perl 6** is also bringing many strange things that some people really seem to be proud of. For example **Grammars**. I don't want to write and don't care about some **"Grammars"** - it may be the next best fantastic thing after inventing the alphabet, but I just want to write code solving my problem! Give me break with a **"Grammar"**... Apologies for not being as smart as the others.

Also, I realized that **Perl 5** got a bad name as being **"Write only"** language. I wish the **Leadership** spent the time to promote the Best practices in the meantime and showing the world how great, nice and clean the **Perl 5** code can be.

Oh well... the world will move on and I can only hope **Perl 5** will raise again like a **Phoenix**. Until then I am doing the **Perl Weekly** exercises parallel also in the serpent language.

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Lubos:** I am not really sure, most likely somebody mentioned it on **Twitter**. I did **"Project Euler"** and **"Advent of Code"** excercises before, so it immediately jumped to my attention.

***

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Lubos:** I really like that it is released every week and that the exercises are taking about the time I have for them in the evening.

They are also very interesting and fun, for example the LZW or the full text search indexes are bringing me many **"aha"** moments.

***

**Mohammad:** Is there any thing you would like to change?

**Lubos:** Yes, I wish that **Perl 5** would regain the space it deserves.

***

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Lubos:** It depends, but on the average a couple of hours. Usually the excercises are done pretty fast and then I spend some time reading about the background of the problem.

***

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favourite?

**Lubos:** When I have time I go through the Git tree backwards and read the code. My favourite has been **E.Choroba**, another **Czech** in the game.

***

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started the weekly challenge?

**Lubos:** Just do it :)

***

**Mohammad:** Do you find the website user friendly? What do you like most?

**Lubos:** The website is extremely nice and easy to use. I like that it brings to my attention directly the text that I need - quite the opposite of the **"modern"** tablet-optimized endless-pages web design I tend to see in recent years.

***

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like share with us?

**Lubos:** Thank you for the great challenge. I really appreciate that you are taking concrete steps to promote the **Perl** language.

***

That brings the end of the conversation with **Lubos Kolouch**. Please do let us know your view. We will come back next week with another champion.
