Welcome to the weekly series **"Meet The Champion"**.

Last week we spoke to **Dave Jacoby**, the winner of **[Perl Weekly Challenge - 029](/blog/meet-the-champion-029)**.

Today we are talking to the **[Perl Weekly Challenge - 030](/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-030)** winner **Kevin Colyer**. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Kevin:** This is an interesting question as I am a hobby programmer. I am a self-taught programmer starting as a teenager with an **8-bit Atari** computer. I learnt **BASIC** (perhaps this is where my love of sigils comes from?) then **6520** assembler. I loved writing text adventures. I think the interest in parsing for games has drawn me to **Perl**. My original direction after school was a Maths/Computer science degree. However, my life has taken a very different direction as I been in church work here and in Belgium for decades and recently become a minister in the church of England! All along I have tinkered and taught myself different computer languages. I have a strong affinity with the ethical roots of free/libre computing. I have written a number of tools that have helped me in my admin work over the years. Recently I have a rather shaky group of **Perl 5** scripts that take my essays written in Markdown and process them with Pandoc and Latex. It works for me!

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using **Perl5**?

**Kevin:** I never could get my head around **Perl 5** at first. I looked at the listings in magazines and couldn't make head nor tail of much **Perl**. What were those functions operating on? The concept of a default variable was a hard one to learn due to its absence! However, I came across one of the early **Perl6 Advent** calendars and was stunned by some of the concepts, like the **reduction operator, map, grep** etc. **Raku**, was well, glacially slow then. So I looked into **Perl5** instead, which was somewhat swifter!

As I looked deeper into Perl5 I found all sorts of treasures. The **TAP** unit-testing was simple, but the culture of testing changed the way I programmed. The multi-paradigm nature of **Perl5** has vast amounts to teach. Then I learned **RegExps**. I had two things to learn now!

I think I love the expressive nature of **Perl** and the depth of thought that has gone into its development.

Now **Perl 6** => **Raku** is getting fast enough more of my projects are tending towards it. I have written a very bad chess engine in **Raku!**

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Kevin:** Perl Weekly News I think.

---

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Kevin:** Programming challenges are great for learning. I enjoy puzzles and having my horizons broadened. When a community shares their solutions there is so much to look at and learn from!

---

**Mohammad:** Is there any thing you would like to change?

**Kevin:** No! I think it is great!

---

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Kevin:** I like to spend a couple of hours or more, mostly on my day off. Great way to unwind.

---

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favourite?

**Kevin:** I look most weeks to see other entries and have a peep. I always read those who blog about their entries.

---

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started the weekly challenge?

**Kevin:** Read the documentation. I've been plundering the **Perl 6** documentation site as many of the solutions are hiding in plain site there.

---

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like share with us?

**Kevin:** Can I just say a big thank you to everyone who has made **Perl(s)** what they are today. I include all those who are just members of communities (and lurk a lot like me!) as their contribution is indirect but vital.

---

That brings the end of the conversation with **Kevin Colyer**. Please do let us know your view. We will come back next week with another champion.
