Welcome to the weekly series **"Meet The Champion"**.

Last week we spoke to **Mark Senn**, the winner of **[Perl Weekly Challenge - 031](/blog/meet-the-champion-031)**.

Today we are talking to the **[Perl Weekly Challenge - 032](/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-032)** winner **Prajith P.**. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Prajith:** Nothing much actually. I started Programming in **Bash** when I got my first job as a Linux server administrator at **Ndimensionz**. In the last **7 years**, I’ve worked on different areas like **Computer Networks**, **Security Researcher**, **System Administration** and as a **Devops Engineer**. Since **2017**, I have been working as a **Devops Engineer** for an E-Commerce company.

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using **Perl5**?

**Prajith:** I started using **Perl5** as a shell script replacement and later I came to know about **Dancer** and **Mojolicious** web frameworks. I was very much interested in creating web applications, so thought to give a try with **Dancer** as it is easy to learn when compared with **Mojolicious**. Now, I'm more into **AWS automation**'s so have been using **Perl5** heavily at work.

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Prajith:** I think from **Perl Weekly Newsletter**.

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Prajith:** I think this kind of challenges are great for learning and improving programming skills and also an opportunity to learn some of the best practices from others as well.

---

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Prajith:** Depends, mostly less than 4 hours.

---

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favourite?

**Prajith:** Actually, yes I do. I check all the solutions, but only after completing my own. I don’t have any favorites, but I used to read **Laurent Rosenfeld** blog posts.

---

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started the weekly challenge?

**Prajith:** Just have fun and enjoy writing code.

---

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like share with us?

**Prajith:** Nothing.
