Welcome to the weekly series **"Meet The Champion"**.

Last week we spoke to **Ulrich Rieke**, the winner of **[Perl Weekly Challenge - 033](/blog/meet-the-champion-033)**.

Today we are talking to the **[Perl Weekly Challenge - 034](/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-034)** winner **Burkhard Nickels**. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Burkhard:** Maybe I start with my private computer interests: Surely **Perl; Linux**, I installed **Debian Linux** on all my rather old computers; Now it is also **Raspberry Pi**; I did a little **C/C++**, **HTML/CSS/Javascript**; I wish to do a little with **Computer Vision** and **Robotics**.

My professional background is, I am working at **'Deutsche Telekom IT'**, I studied **Electrical Engineering/Telecomunication** in the end of the 80s. I am working as a **Systems Engineer**, actually as **Problem Manager** but before in a lot of areas like **System** and **Network administration**, **Interfaces in Telecommunication**, **Testing** and feasibility studies etc.

In my work I used **Perl** in creating simulations, interface testing and load and performance test drivers.

---

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using **Perl**/**Raku**?

**Burkhard:** I do not know exactly, but I think I started with **Perl** already in the 90's.

---

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Burkhard:** From time to time I read perl things on the net, also **Perl Weekly**. Most likely I saw it first on **Perl Weekly**. And then I decided to participate in the **Perl Weekly Challenge**.

---

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Burkhard:** I started recently with [**"Perl Weekly Challenge - 029"**](/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-029), so I am rather new to "**Perl Weekly Challenge**". One important thing is that I like **Perl**. Than my intention was to get some trust in publishing things. Loose some fear that it is not good enough or not complete enough to publish, simply send it out. Now I realize that I also learn a lot, recap things that I already did or find some new things. Having a different view on some perl things with also documenting the solutions.

---

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Burkhard:** This time "**Perl Weekly Challenge - 034**" I spent a lot of time, rather the whole week. I mean, the rest of the day beside sleeping, work, household, caring for my son, accompanying him to football etc.

The reason was, that I searched the net for **Hash Slices**, I did not know it before, I knew **Array Slices**. And I found, not only **Hash Slices**, but also **"Steganograhy"**. I do not know what it is, but it was about hiding one image in another image. And it was in my head. And there was no other way than to get this thing done. Normally I spend an evening or two, up to a whole day (on weekends).

---

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favourite?

**Burkhard:** I read the review and I looked a little bit around to learn how other do some things, but also because of time not very deep. So I do not have favourites.

---

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started the weekly challenge?

**Burkhard:** I just started and for me it was good to simply start with sending the code per email and still being welcome. So simply do it.

---

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like share with us?

**Burkhard:** Yes, thank you very much for all your efforts you are doing with the "**Perl Weekly Challenge**". I discovered for me the fun in doing this small **Perl** examples.

---

That brings the end of the conversation with **Burkhard Nickels**. Please do let us know your view. We will come back next week with another champion.
