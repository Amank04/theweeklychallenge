Welcome to the weekly series **"Meet The Champion"**.

Last week we spoke to **Burkhard Nickels**, the winner of **[Perl Weekly Challenge - 034](/blog/meet-the-champion-034)**.

Today we are talking to the **[Perl Weekly Challenge - 035](/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-035)** winner **Steven Wilson**. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Steven:** Around **10 years** ago I was working in **MIS** in a local college and started to study **Computing and Mathematics** through the **Open University** which resulted in a degree. Since then I've continued to add to my knowledge, working though books and various online courses, learning languages but forgetting a lot also because they go unused.

---

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using **Perl**/**Raku**?

**Steven:** I've been programming in **Perl** for only **5 years**. I was a **FLOSS Weekly** viewer and decided to purchase **Randal**'s book to try it out.

---

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Steven:** From the **Perl Weekly** newsletter.

---

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Steven:** That I have a reason to practice **Perl** and I get to learn from more experienced people. I feel like I'm no longer having to relearn the basics whenever I write some **Perl** code.

---

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Steven:** From **an hour** to **many hours** depending on the amount of time I have, how interested I am in the task and how difficult it is.

---

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favourite?

**Steven:** Yes, I usually wait for the **Kian-Meng Ang Weekly Review** and checkout the highlights.

---

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started the weekly challenge?

**Steven:** Try to do something every week but it's ok if you miss a week.

---

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like share with us?

**Steven:** I'd just like to thank you for putting in the time and effort to make it happen.

---

That brings the end of the conversation with **Steven Wilson**. Please do let us know your view. We will come back next week with another champion.
