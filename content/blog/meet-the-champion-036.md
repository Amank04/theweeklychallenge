Welcome to the weekly series **"Meet The Champion"**.

Last week we spoke to **Steven Wilson**, the winner of **[Perl Weekly Challenge - 035](/blog/meet-the-champion-035)**.

Today we are talking to the **[Perl Weekly Challenge - 036](/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-036)** winner **Duane Powell**. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Duane:** After getting a **BS degree** in **Computer Science** in **1985**, I worked for a handful of defense contractors designing databases and writing programs in **C**. In the mid 90's, I was going to night school for a masters in **Information Engineering** but dropped out to start a computer animation studio with some friends. That studio's work was nominated for an **Oscar** in **2005** for the short comedy animation **"Gopher Broke"**.

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using **Perl**/**Raku**?

**Duane:** I started using **Perl** in the late **90**'s. Over the years as the studio grew from **3 computers** on-prem to **3000** in **IaaS**, **Perl** became the super glue that held everything together. I love this language, it really makes programming fun. Shamefully instead of using **CPAN**, I wrote a **ORM** that sat on top of the **Postgresql**. A **Perl** daemon/job queue that the artists submitted their work too for rendering. I wrote a lot of **Perl** daemons using the **ORM** and **rsync** to wrangle the studio's **4 petabytes** of files: A backup system, a configuration management system, and a remote sync system so we could integrate offsite artist's data into our pipeline. Big studios like **Disney** are paranoid about security, with **Perl** I was able to write an air-gapped network solution to move files between corporate and production LANs and pass their security audits.

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Duane:** I was Googling for **Perl** recipes and found **Gabor Szabo**'s **Perl Weekly**, that led me to the **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**.

---

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Duane:** I like reading other programmers code and learning new techniques.

---

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Duane:** I spend on average about **4 hours**.

---

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favourite?

**Duane:** I read the winners code. I usually check out **Andrezgz**, **Laurent Rosenfeld**, **E. Choroba** and **Yet Ebreo**'s solutions. **Raku** is fascinating so I like reading those solutions as well.

---

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started the weekly challenge?

**Duane:** Next time you get stuck where you can't see the forest for the trees go take a solo walk, often you will see the solution or bug in your minds eye.

---

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like share with us?

**Duane:** Thank you so much for running the **"Perl Weekly Challenge"** and bringing programmers together. **Perl** is such a powerful tool and it's nice to be part of the community that appreciates this great language.

---

That brings the end of the conversation with **Duane Powell**. Please do let us know your view. We will come back next week with another champion.
