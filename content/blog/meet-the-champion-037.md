Welcome to the weekly series **"Meet The Champion"**.

Last week we spoke to **Duane Powell**, the winner of **[Perl Weekly Challenge - 036](/blog/meet-the-champion-036)**.

Today we are talking to the **[Perl Weekly Challenge - 037](/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-037)** winner **Javier Luque**. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Javier:** I work for a company called **Humanstate** based in **Sevenoaks** and we run a platform called **GivenGain** that allows fundraisers to raise money for their favourite charities. Prior to **Humanstate** I worked as a **Developer** for **Legacy.com**.

I started as a **C/C++** developer and became a **Perl** developer when I moved to the UK. I also have quite a bit of experience with **React** and **Elasticsearch**.

---

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using **Perl**/**Raku**?

**Javier:** I've been using **Perl** for over **15 years** now, as for **Raku**, I only started using it when I began this challenge. In fact, I'm using this challenge as a motivational tool to learn **Raku**.

---

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Javier:** Some of my colleagues and I saw your talk during the **London Perl Workshop** and I decided to participate as the challenges looked fun and interesting. You were very passionate about the **"Perl Weekly Challenge"** and I felt inspired and compelled to participate.

---

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Javier:** Some of the challenges are quite fun and different to the challenges faced during everyday work. I also like that I'm able to learn **Raku**. **Raku** is so feature rich that a lot of my time is spent learning how to do things in **Raku**. I've occasionally cheated and asked a fellow colleague for some help with the syntax especially in my first week.

---

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Javier:** It really depends, some weeks are quite simple and take me a little over **an hour**. The longest I spent was this challenge which took about **4 hours**. The hardest part for me is transforming **Perl** into **Raku** and wrapping my head around some of the feature rich methods incorporated in **Raku**.

I try to learn something new every week and this week I learned about the **polymod method** which was quite useful in this challenge.

---

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favourite?

**Javier:** I don't really have the time to check other people's solutions but I read the recap when **Laurent Rosenfeld** and **Kian-Meng Ang** posts them. Then you have these **"AHA"** moments and realize you could have solved the problem a whole different way. I like those moments as they help you grow as a person and developer.

---

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started the weekly challenge?

**Javier:** If you're learning **Raku** like I was, it helps to ask for help, especially the first time you use it and install it.

I made the mistake and calling the interpreter with the shebang and of course this didn't work as intended. What's worse is that I thought it was working because on the Mac `say "hello world"` actually works.

---

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like share with us?

**Javier:** I really enjoy during these challenges. They help when I have some downtime. I honestly think more people should do them, as it helps you think outside the box of everyday work.

---

That brings the end of the conversation with **Javier Luque**. Please do let us know your view. We will come back next week with another champion.
