Welcome to the weekly series **"Meet The Champion"**.

Last week we spoke to **Colin Crain**, the winner of **[Perl Weekly Challenge - 039](/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-039)**.

Today we are talking to the **[Perl Weekly Challenge - 040](/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-040)** winner **Noud Aldenhoven**. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Noud:** Starting from a young age I've always been interested in **Science and Technology**. I have a **degree in Mathematics** and a **PhD in Mathematical Physics**. At this moment I'm working as data scientist at **Nutreco**, an international company that created **Animal Nutrition and Aquafeed**. My specialization is **understanding**, **investigating**, **optimizing** and **improving (complex) pipelines** in companies. Let's say I'm just good with numbers.

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using **Perl**/**Raku**?

**Noud:** I started learning **Raku** when I joined **Perl Weekly Challenge**. Ofcourse, I had quite a lot of experience in a dozen of other languages, so it didn't take long to learn the basics of **Raku**. What I like about **Raku** is that the language doesn't force you to program in a certain way. **Functional programming?** Here you have your **lambda functions** and **lazy lists**. **Object-Oriented?** Sure, **Raku** has **Classes**. **Metaprogramming?** No problem, why not? Did you know that **Raku** supports **logical programming** as well? Unlike many other languages, such as **Python**, there is not one **"best"** way to solve a problem in **Raku**.

Unfortunately I'm not using **Raku** at work. Therefore, the challenges of **Perl Weekly Challenge** are exactly the thing I needed to continue practicing **Raku**.

---

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Noud:** I saw **Perl Weekly Challenge** first popping up on **ycombinator's hacker news**.

---

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Noud:** I like the accessible setup. It's easy to make contributions and, most of the time, it doesn't take me too long to solve the weekly challenges. Also I like the weekly reviews of [**Laurent Rosenfeld**](/p6-reviews) and [**Kian-Meng Ang**](/p5-reviews). **Laurent Rosenfeld** does a great job reviewing the solutions of the participant and giving an overview of all possible ways a problem could be solved.

---

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Noud:** Depends a bit on the time I have every week and how difficult the challenges are. I think most challenges are solved in **1 to 2 Friday evening hours**.

---

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favourite?

**Noud:** YES! But I don't have a particular favourite. I always read the review of **Laurent Rosenfield**. I think I learned more **Raku** from other peoples solutions in the review than from my own solutions.

---

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started the weekly challenge?

**Noud:** Practice makes perfect. Being consistent will make you a little bit better every week. *Try to solve one or two tasks every week*. If you do this long enough you become the master.

---

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like share with us?

**Noud:** **Perl Weekly Challenge** is one of the best initiatives I've seen in years. Keep up the good work and happy new year!

That brings the end of the conversation with **Noud Aldenhoven**. Please do let us know your view. We will come back next week with another champion.
