Welcome to the monthly series **"Meet The Champion"**.

Last month we spoke to **Saif Ahmed**, the winner of **[February 2020](/blog/meet-the-champion-2020-02)**.

Today we are talking to **Alicia Bielsa**, the winner of **March 2020** of **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Alicia:** I studied Humanities and did not start learning about computers until I was in my thirties. Until then I worked at coffee shops, restaurants and in a bank. In **2007**, I was lucky to be able to participate in a program that aimed to integrate graduates from other disciplines into the IT Industry. This consisted a one year training course in **Belfast Metropolitan College**. From then on I've worked in various posts in the IT Industry in **Belfast**, **London** and **Spain**. I've learned quite a lot at work and also in on-line courses and tutorials.

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using **Perl**/**Raku**?

**Alicia:** I started using **Perl** in the year **2013** when I got a job as **Perl Programmer**. I learned checking online tutorials and using **Perl Critic** for guidance. I've used **Perl** in most of the jobs I've had since and it's definitely my top favorite programming language. At the moment I'm trying to learn **Raku** with the weekly challenge and doing the **Raku** track in Exercism which I'm finding to be a very useful site.

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Alicia:** I think I read about it in the **Gabor Szabo**'s **[Perl Weekly Newsletter](https://perlweekly.com)**.

---

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Alicia:** It gives me a chance to remember why I like programming. Work can be quite dull, but the **Weekly Challenge** is always fun.

---

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**?

**Alicia:** I try to think about the challenges on the train on my way to work **Monday** morning and I might write some pseudo-code in a notebook. I will discuss the challenges with my work colleague and fellow contributor **Cristina Heredia**. Usually I'll do the challenges on the weekend, I would say it can take me **1-2 hours** each to code if I don't get stuck, but it really depends on how difficult the task is.

---

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favourite?

**Alicia:** I always try to read the review. In the last week's I liked **Colin Crain**'s solution as it is easy to read and has lots of comments. It is great to see the different ways people do things. :-)

---

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started the weekly challenge?

**Alicia:** Use it to learn and to have fun. The reviewers comments are always very kind and useful and you can learn lots from other people's solutions.

---

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like share with us?

**Alicia:** Thanks to everyone that makes this challenge possible, it is the highlight of my week. It is great to see that there are more people that loves **Perl** than I do.

---

That brings the end of the conversation with **Alicia Bielsa**. Please do let us know your view. We will come back next month with another champion.
