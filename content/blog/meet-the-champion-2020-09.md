Welcome to the monthly series `Meet The Champion`.

Last month we spoke to **Cheok-Yin Fung**, the winner of **[August 2020](/blog/meet-the-champion-2020-08)**.

Today we are talking to **Myoungjin Jeon**, the winner of **September 2020** of `The Weekly Challenge`. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

---

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Myoungjin:** I remember that my first programming language was `GW-BASIC`. I was not good at it though. I tried to learn `C/C++` by myself during my high school but still have no success. When I was a freshman in **2001**, I came across a circle using `Linux OS` and my interest towards **Computer Science** started growing. However my journey was ended because I have changed the job since I arrived in **Australia**. I am a professional chef now and also a life coder.

---

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using **Perl**?

**Myoungjin:** `Perl` was everywhere in `Linux` operating system and very popular also. It was natural to know about `Perl` itself, furthermore after making simple **GUI** progam in `Perl` with `Gtk2Perl` module as a hobby, I have fallen in love with `Perl`.

---

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Myoungjin:** I was looking for new information about `Raku` (actually Perl6) at blog.perl.org and found a curious link by reading **Laurent**'s blog post about weekly challenge. And I had enough time to spare because my working hours reduced during this pandemic so I decided to solve some problem!

---

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Myoungjin:** **"Freedom to learn and post"** is the first thing I'd like to say. As a **Perl**'s nature there are a wide range of solutions appear every weeks. Unfortuenately I don't understand some solutions due to lack of my technique but I have still chance to read them.

---

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Myoungjin:** A lot of time literally, and I have spent more time because I wanted to learn other languages as well. It was fantastic opportunity to translate from a language to others and compare them. I have tried to make a my own web site for future, which I can use in a Restaurant or Takeaway shop.

---

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favourite?

**Myoungjin:** I was too busy to read other's solution because I spent too much time to write my own solution. :-)  I am always waiting for the review of `Colin Crain` and `Andrew Shitov`. I am huge fan of them. I cannot imagine how it is hard to read other's code and review!! I always surprised by other simple or impressed by thoughtful solution. I hope that I could write down nice comments like `Jorg Sommrey` one day. `Athanasius` always impress me by his explanation and reference to source. `E. Choroba` codes also easily catch my eyes every weeks and .. let me keep it as lazy evalutaion... and I just started to read other's `Raku` code since few weeks ago. and I found a whole new world in there.

---

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Myoungjin:** Keep going! You can study a language better when you are writing a working code everyday! It has been 2 months since I studied `Haskell`. It was invaluable experiece. And I found `Raku` is so well designed language. It is unfortunate that `Raku` is still struggling to get more attention.

---

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like share with us?

**Myoungjin:** IMHO, We maybe need to pay more attention on web applications. It would be great if I had any chance to learn with `Perl` and Web at the same time. :-)

---

That brings the end of the conversation with **Myoungjin Jeon**. Please do let us know your view. We will come back next month with another champion.
