# Get to know about Stuart Little

Welcome to the monthly series `Meet The Champion`.

Last month we spoke to **Niels van Dijke**, the winner of **[December 2020](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/meet-the-champion-2020-12)**.

Today we are talking to **Stuart Little**, the winner of **January 2021** of `The Weekly Challenge`. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

---

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Stuart:** I don't work in **IT** or make a living as a programmer, so on that front I consider myself an amateur.

---

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using **Perl**/**Raku**?

**Stuart:** Not sure about Perl/Raku specifically, but sometime before **2014** (not long before though) I had to move away from **Windows XP** and installed **Ubuntu** on a rickety netbook. Everything followed more or less naturally:

- some clumsy bash to automate basic tasks
- plus sed/awk/whatever
- then Perl
- by that stage programming languages were interesting to me in their own right, so I got to watch much of the **Perl6-to-Raku** saga.

---

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Stuart:** I honestly can't remember!

When I become interested in a language curiosity drives me to seek out resources: manuals, blogs, youtube, etc. I'll venture a guess some blog must have introduced me to **PWC**, but recalling which one seems hopeless.

I will note, though, that this goes to show how important the blog posts our PWC colleagues write are!

---

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Stuart:** That it was, for me, an excellent motivator to learn.

While I'd written **Perl**/**Raku** scripts for personal use before joining **PWC**, I'd never written a line of **Haskell**. I knew of it and was curious, but having very specific, beginner-friendly problems to guide one through a deep dive is priceless.

---

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Stuart:** I'll usually work on challenges sporadically over the day they come out, in between other tasks.

The engagement was more intense as I was going through the past challenges systematically in **Raku**/**Haskell**, but it's toned down now.

---

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favorite?

**Stuart:** I have, on occasion: when going through past challenges, I found a few just the teeniest bit unclear and looked up others' solutions for clarification.

So I don't do it often, but find it instructive when I do!

---

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Stuart:** Just jump in! The community is *very* welcoming.

---

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like to share with us?

**Stuart:** Only to say `thank you` (to everyone involved): for initiating this in the first place, for hosting and promoting **PWC** so consistently and tenaciously, and for providing an enjoyable motivation to learn and grow.

---

That brings the end of the conversation with **Stuart Little**. Please do let us know your view. We will come back next month with another champion.
