# Get to know about Aaron Smith

Welcome to the monthly series `Meet The Champion`.

Last month we spoke to **Tyler Wardhaugh**, the winner of **March 2021**.

Today we are talking to **Aaron Smith**, the winner of **April 2021** of `The Weekly Challenge`. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Aaron:** I started programming when I was in grad school for **Bioinformatics**. **Bioinformatics** relies heavily on **Python** and **Perl** (especially [BioPerl](https://bioperl.org/)) scripting, so that was my first introduction to the **Perl** ecosystem. I have since left the **Bioinformatics** space and now work as a **Senior Data Engineer** in the cybersecurity industry, where my day job consists of mostly **Scala** and **Spark**.

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using **Raku**?

**Aaron:** I first got introduced to **Raku** (then known as Perl 6) in 2017. I was browsing through a resource called [Exercism](https://exercism.io/tracks/raku), which aids in learning new programming languages. Since I already knew **Perl 5**, I wanted to see what **Raku** was all about.

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Aaron:** I saw a blog post on the [Raku subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/rakulang) that was about `The Weekly Challenge` and wanted to see what it was about.

---

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Aaron:** I have no place to use Raku outside of `The Weekly Challenge`. I have a nine-month-old, so personal project are few and far between, and there hasn't been a professional use case (yet) where I have been able to use **Raku**. So it's nice to have _something_ to be able to flex those muscles every week.

---

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Aaron:** Probably about an hour or two; I am only able to look at it on the weekends during my son's nap! Most of that time is just writing and formatting my [blog](https://aaronreidsmith.github.io/).

---

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favorite?

**Aaron:** I checkout the ones that are posted on the Raku subreddit. Generally that ends up being [Arne Sommer](https://github.com/arnesom) and [Laurent Rosenfeld](https://github.com/LaurentRosenfeld), so I guess they are my favorites!

---

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Aaron:** Just hop in and have fun! If you find the challenges too difficult, there is a fairly large community willing to help. If you find them too easy, you can always set your own challenges -- maybe try a new language or programming paradigm to add some difficulty?

---

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like to share with us?

**Aaron:** Just a big **thank you** for putting all of this together week after week; it has been a lot of fun to be part of the community!

That brings the end of the conversation with **Aaron Smith**. Please do let us know your view. We will come back next month with another champion.
