Today **December 25, 2019**, we completed **9 months** of weekly challenges. The **Year 2019** will remain very special to all of us associated with **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**. We just celebrated [**Advent Calendar**](/blog/advent-calendar-2019) for the first time. It was fun revisiting some of the great contributions by fellow members.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank our sole sponsor, **Peter Sergeant** of [**PerlCareers**](https://perl.careers). We are looking for more sponsors in the **Year 2020**. Any *contributions* would be highly appreciated.

## Damian Conway

One of the achievements of the **"Perl Weekly Challenge"** was able to attract the attention of **Damian Conway**. I was pleasantly surprised to see him going into the finer details of the challenge every week. I didn't want to loose the track of his great work. Therefore I decided to create [**one-stop**](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/damian-corner) placeholder to have all his work listed.

## Kian-Meng Ang

**Kian-Meng** has been reviewing the **Perl** contributions since **Week 007**. We have had many positive responses by the **Champions** appreciating the work done every week. I would like to take this opportunity to say big **THANK YOU** for the hard work and commitments.

Please checkout the [**contributions**](/p5-reviews).

## Laurent Rosenfeld

**Laurent** started reviewing the **Raku** contributions few weeks after **Kian-Meng Ang**. However he not only does weekly review but does past weeks as well. I appreciate the time he spend in reviewing the contributions. I can't **THANK** him enough for his support.

Please checkout the [**contributions**](/p6-reviews).

## Gabor Szabo

At the start of **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**, **Gabor**'s acceptance of the weekly challenge was a big motivation. He even gave regular space in his the most popular [**Perl Weekly Newsletter**](http://perlweekly.com). He even proposed the idea of **API challenge**. Unfortunately we had to drop the challenge after few months because of lack of interest. We will re-boot it in slightly different format next year.

## Neil Bowers

**Neil** has been participating in the **"Perl Weekly Challenge"** on/off. The highlight of his contributions was his work on **Detect Language API**. He even created **CPAN** module [**WebService::DetectLanguage**](https://metacpan.org/pod/WebService::DetectLanguage). Later he contacted the [**official website**](https://detectlanguage.com) and got the **Perl** client listed there.

## Oretis Zekai

**Oretis** contacted us during the [**Perl Weekly Challenge - 018**](/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-018) and shared his solutions to [**Task #1**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-018/orestis-zekai/python/ch-1.py) and [**Task #2**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-018/orestis-zekai/python/ch-2.py) in **Python**. It started the trend and few weeks later regular members also joined him and started solving weekly challenges in languages like **C++**, **Go**, **Haskell**, **Javascript**, **Python**, **Postscript**, **Rust** and **HTML**. The following members have contributed so far in alphabetical orders:

**Adam Russell**, **Daniel Mita**, **Dave Jacoby**, **Duncan C. White**, **Lubos Kolouch**, **Rage311**, **Roger Bell_West** and **Ulrich Rieke**.
