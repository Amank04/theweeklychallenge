Last week challenge turned out to be a cakewalk for Perl 6 hackers. This shows my lack of knowledge of Perl 6. I have requested our inhouse Perl 6 experts to share some challenging questions. I already received few and kept in the challenge bank. I will use it in the coming weeks. Credit will be given to the hacker when published. We highly recommend that you submit you solutions as PR to the [repository](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club). If you need help with regard to submitting Pull Request, there is handy [guide](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/README.md). A gentle reminder, please don't try to golf your solution. We are looking for unique way to solve the problem. Last week, newly joined member even submit test script, which is handy but not required. Also please mention any prereqs to execute the solution i.e. version of Perl or Raku. Please add meaningful comment to your code, in case anyone (most likely me) reading your code. Avoid using external library as much as possible. Try to get the solution straight out of the language. We encourage you to blog about your solution, focus on how you achieve the result. If you do blog then please share with us.

Last but not the least if you have any suggestions for future challenges then please do share with us. Good luck and have fun.
