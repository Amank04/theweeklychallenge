The best part of the **Perl Weekly Challenge** is reading the blog by the members. Personally, I like the journey of an idea to final solution. If you look at closely all the blogs, every member has unique style. They all think differently but ends up with the same result. I have become fan of few in the last few weeks. Don't get me wrong, reading code is fascinating but boring. If you read the story behind each approach is amazingly blockbuster.

### RECAP
Here is the recap of last week [challenge](/blog/recap-challenge-004).

### CHART
We now have **Perl Weekly Challenge Leaders** [chart](/chart) that gets updated regularly every time we get new solution.

Last but not the least if you have any suggestions for future challenges then please do share with us. Good luck and have fun.

### Challenge #1
> Write a program which prints out all anagrams for a given word. For more information about Anagram, please check this [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram) page.

### Challenge #2
> Write a program to find the sequence of characters that has the most anagrams.

Last week Gabor Szabo suggested I should add another optional challenge every week asking members to provide Perl implementation to a given API. You don't have to create a module, since it is an API. I am working out on the format currently. If you have any suggestions in this regard then please do share with us.

#### DISCLAIMER: Challenge 005 idea was suggested by Neil Bowers.

Last date to submit the solution **6 pm (UK Time) Sunday 28th April 2019**.
