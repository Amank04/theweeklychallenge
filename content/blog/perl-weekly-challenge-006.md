**Perl Weekly Challenge** introduced me to so many genious around the globe. It would be unfair to name a few. You know who I am talking about. The main objective of the project was to introduce **Perl** to more people and allow sharing the magic of **Perl**. In the last 5 weeks, I can say that I have personally learnt a lot from many greats.

***

### RECAP
Here is the recap of last week [challenge](/blog/recap-challenge-005).

***

### CHART
I have added new chart **Perl Weekly Challenge Language Breakdown** [chart](/chart) showing **Perl 5** and **Perl 6** weekly usage.

I would like to thank everyone for your valuable suggestions. Please do share your experience with us. Good luck for the weekly challenge, enjoy.

***

### Challenge #1
> Create a script which takes a list of numbers from command line and print the same in the compact form. For example, if you pass "1,2,3,4,9,10,14,15,16" then it should print the compact form like "1-4,9,10,14-16".


### Challenge #2
> Create a script to calculate **Ramanujan's constant** with at least 32 digits of precision. Find out more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heegner_number#Almost_integers_and_Ramanujan's_constant).

***

Last week I asked your view about introducing optional third question every week about providing Perl implementation of a given API. I want to give one more week before throwing the third question in the pool. I don't expect you to create a module, since it is an API. If you have any suggestions in this regard then please do share with us.

Last date to submit the solution **6 pm (UK Time) Sunday 5th May 2019**.
