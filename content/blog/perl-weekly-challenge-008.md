I would like to thank everyone for your valuable suggestions. Please do share your experience with us. Good luck for the weekly challenge, enjoy.

### Challenge #1
> Write a script that computes the first five perfect numbers. A perfect number is an integer that is the sum of its positive proper divisors (all divisors except itself). Please check [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number) for more information. This challenge was proposed by **Laurent Rosenfeld**.


### Challenge #2
> Write a function, 'center', whose argument is a list of strings, which will be lines of text. The function should insert spaces at the beginning of the lines of text so that if they were printed, the text would be centered, and return the modified lines.

For example,

    center("This", "is", "a test of the", "center function");

should return the list:

    "     This", "      is", " a test of the", "center function"

because if these lines were printed, they would look like:

           This
            is
       a test of the
      center function

### Challenge #3
> Create a simple perl client for **@mailgun** API. For more infomation visit official [website](https://www.mailgun.com/). This challenge was proposed by **Gabor Szabo**. The API challenge is **optional** and would be part of weekly challenge every week.
