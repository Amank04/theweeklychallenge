The best part of **Perl Weekly Challenge** is that you are **free** to take a break for as long as you want. Even then you are encourged to take a look at others [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club) and enjoy. I personally recommend you should read the blog by the elite members. They are invaluable source of knowledge. Thanks to all the members for participating and blogging about it. Enjoy the challenge.

### Challenge #2
> Write a script to perform different types of ranking as described below:

    1. Standard Ranking (1224): Items that compare equal receive the same ranking number, and then a gap is left in the ranking numbers.
    2. Modified Ranking (1334): It is done by leaving the gaps in the ranking numbers before the sets of equal-ranking items.
    3. Dense Ranking    (1223): Items that compare equally receive the same ranking number, and the next item(s) receive the immediately following ranking number.
