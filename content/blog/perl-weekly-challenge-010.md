I came to know about one secret player of **Perl Weekly Challenge** just few days ago. Any guesses? He is the **Damian Conway**. He doesn't need any introduction. My first encounter with him was when I bought his book **Perl Best Practices**. I have been a big fan of him since then. Checkout his [blog](http://blogs.perl.org/users/damian_conway/2019/05/why-i-love-perl-6.html). I would also like to mention another newly joined member **Yozen Hernandez**. He blogged first time ever that too about his solution to the **Perl Weekly Challenge**. In his [blog](https://yzhernand.github.io/posts/perl-weekly-challenge-9/) he wrote something very nice and sweet at the end.

> I look forward to doing more of these as not only do they seem like a fun way to flex my Perl and problem-solving skills, but I find immense value in reading other people’s solutions. It’s often the case that I find some incredibly creative way of solving the problem, and some solutions are so unique that I learn so much more about this language I thought I understood.

Response like this gives the energy to do better every week.
