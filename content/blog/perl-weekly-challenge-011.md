I noticed regular flow of new members to the team of **Perl Weekly Challenge**. Some of them quite actively take part in the challenge as well as blog about it. Some while on vacation, didn't miss to take on weekly challenge. I remember, one member, submit the solution from her sickbed. I am gratefull to each of them for their support. I am equally thankfull to those who take time and blog about their solution. You guys are doing great service to the community in general. Keep the movement going and please do spread the word.

### Challenge #3

> Using [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/current), write a script to fetch the current weather for an arbitrary city.  Note that you will need to sign up for Open Weather Map's free tier and then wait a couple hours before your API key will be valid. This challenge was proposed by **Joelle Maslak**. The API challenge is **optional** but would love to see your solution.
