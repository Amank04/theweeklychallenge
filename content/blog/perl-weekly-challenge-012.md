### Challenge #1

> The numbers formed by adding one to the products of the smallest primes are called the Euclid Numbers (see [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid_number)). Write a script that finds the smallest **Euclid Number** that is not prime. This challenge was proposed by Laurent Rosenfeld.

### Challenge #2

> Write a script that finds the common directory path, given a collection of paths and directory separator. For example, if the following paths are supplied.

    /a/b/c/d
    /a/b/cd
    /a/b/cc
    /a/b/c/d/e

and the path separator is **/**. Your script should return **/a/b** as common directory path.
