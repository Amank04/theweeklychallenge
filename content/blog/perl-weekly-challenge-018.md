## Task #1

***
***

> Write a script that takes 2 or more strings as command line parameters and print the longest common substring. For example, the longest common substring of the strings **"ABABC"**, **"BABCA"** and **"ABCBA"** is string **"ABC"** of length 3. Other common substrings are **"A", "AB", "B", "BA", "BC"** and **"C"**. Please check this [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_substring_problem) for details.

## Task #2

***
***

> Write a script to implement **Priority Queue**. It is like regular **queue** except each element has a **priority** associated with it. In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority. Please check this [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue) for more informations. It should serve the following operations:

>>    1) **is_empty**: check whether the queue has no elements.

>>    2) **insert_with_priority**: add an element to the queue with an associated priority.

>>    3) **pull_highest_priority_element**: remove the element from the queue that has the highest priority, and return it. If two elements have the same priority, then return element added first.

## Task #3

***
***

> Write a script to use **BabelNet API**. To obtain an API key you have to register an [account](http://babelnet.org/register) on BabelNet. At the end of the registration process, you will receive an email with your API key. For more information about API, please visit [page](https://babelnet.org/guide). The API task is **optional** but we would love to see your solution.

Last date to submit the solution **23:59 (UK Time) Sunday 28th July 2019**.
