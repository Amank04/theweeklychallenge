## Task #1

## Task #2

> Write a script for URL normalization based on [rfc3986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_normalization). This task was shared by **Anonymous Contributor**.

>> According to Wikipedia, **URL normalization** is the process by which URLs are modified and standardized in a consistent manner. The goal of the normalization process is to transform a URL into a normalized URL so it is possible to determine if two syntactically different URLs may be equivalent.
