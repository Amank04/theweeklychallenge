## GUESTS

We welcome contributions in other languages. So far we have had one guest submitting solutions in **Python** in the past. Last week, we didn't receive any contributions from guest.

## Task #1

***
***

> Write a script to print first **10 Sexy Prime Pairs**. Sexy primes are prime numbers that differ from each other by 6. For example, the numbers 5 and 11 are both sexy primes, because **11 - 5 = 6**. The term **"sexy prime"** is a pun stemming from the Latin word for six: sex. For more information, please checkout wiki [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexy_prime).

## Task #2

***
***

> Write a script to implement **Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW)** compression algorithm. The script should have method to **encode/decode** algorithm. The wiki [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch) explains the compression algorithm very nicely.

I must confess, it took me many years to get my head around the compression algorithm, I finally understood while doing research for the task. So thanks to **Perl Weekly Challenge**, I can proudly say that now I understand the compression algorithm. I hope you will enjoy this task as much as I did.

## Task #3

***
***

> Write a script to use **Amazon Pinpoint API**. For more information about the API, please visit [page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/apireference/welcome.html). The API task is **optional** but we would love to see your solution.

Last date to submit the solution **23:59 (UK Time) Sunday 25th August 2019**.
