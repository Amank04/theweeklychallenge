## Task #1

***
***

> Create a script that accepts two strings, let us call it, **"stones"** and **"jewels"**. It should print the count of "alphabet" from the string **"stones"** found in the string **"jewels"**. For example, if your **stones** is **"chancellor"** and **"jewels"** is **"chocolate"**, then the script should print **"8"**. To keep it simple, only A-Z,a-z characters are acceptable. Also make the comparison case sensitive.

***
***

## Task #2

***
***

> Create a script that prints **mean angles** of the given list of angles in degrees. Please read [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_of_circular_quantities) that explains the formula in details with an example.

***
***

## Task #3

***
***

> We decided to put the optional API task on hold for the time being, while we are working on the format.

***
***

Last date to submit the solution **23:59 (UK Time) Sunday 22nd September 2019**.
