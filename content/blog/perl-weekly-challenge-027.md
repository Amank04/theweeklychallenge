## Task #1

***
***

> Write a script to find the intersection of two straight lines. The co-ordinates of the two lines should be provided as command line parameter. For example:

>> The two ends of **Line 1** are represented as co-ordinates **(a,b)** and **(c,d)**.
>>
>> The two ends of **Line 2** are represented as co-ordinates **(p,q)** and **(r,s)**.

The script should print the co-ordinates of point of intersection of the above two lines.

***
***

## Task #2

***
***

> Write a script that allows you to capture/display historical data. It could be an object or a scalar. For example

>> my $x = 10;
>> $x = 20;
>> $x -= 5;

After the above operations, it should list **$x** historical value in order.
