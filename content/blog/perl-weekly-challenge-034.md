## HEADLINES

With great pleasure, we announce **Ulrich Rieke** as the winner of [**"Perl Weekly Challenge - 033"**](/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-033). Congratulations **Ulrich**, you should soon hear from **[Perl Careers](https://perl.careers/)** about your reward. For rest of the participants, I would say **Good Luck** for next time. Keep sending in your solutions and share your knowledge with each other.

I am working on the format of **Perl Weekly Challenge Advent Calendar** currently. It would be a collection of **24** most popular solutions ever submitted by the members. Therefore, I request all members to send us their favourite, specially **Kian-Meng Ang** and **Laurent Rosenfeld**, as they have been reviewing solutions every week. Once we shortlist the **24** solutions, we would then reach out to the member who contributed the solution and request to write a short blog about it. If they have blogged about it already then we would try to use it appropriately.
