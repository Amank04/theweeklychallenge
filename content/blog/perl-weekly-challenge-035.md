## TASK #1
##### Contributed by Paul Johnson

***
***

### Write a program to encode text into binary encoded morse code.

***

Pay attention to any changes which might need to be made to the text to make it valid morse code.

[**Morse code**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) consists of dots, dashes and gaps. It can be encoded in binary in the following fashion:

##### dot: 1

##### dash: 111

##### intra-character gap: 0

##### character gap: 000

##### word gap: 0000000

An intra-character gap is inserted between the dots and dashes in a character.

***
***

## TASK #2
##### Contributed by Paul Johnson

***
***

### Write a program to decode binary morse code.

***

Consider how it might be possible to recover from badly formed morse code.

##### a) by splitting the morse code on gaps

##### b)  without looking further than one digit ahead

Last date to submit the solution **23:59 (UK Time) Sunday 24th November 2019**.
