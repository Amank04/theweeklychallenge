### Show multiple arrays content

You are given **two** or more arrays. Write a script to display values of each list at a given index.

For example:

#### Array 1: [ I L O V E Y O U ]

#### Array 2: [ 2 4 0 3 2 0 1 9 ]

#### Array 3: [ ! ? £ $ % ^ & * ]

We expect the following output:

    I 2 !
    L 4 ?
    O 0 £
    V 3 $
    E 2 %
    Y 0 ^
    O 1 &
    U 9 *

## TASK #2

### Sort SubList

You are given a list of numbers and set of indices belong to the list. Write a script to sort the values belongs to the indices.

For example,

#### List: [ 10, 4, 1, 8, 12, 3 ]

#### Indices: 0,2,5

We would sort the values at indices **0, 2 and 5** i.e. **10, 1 and 3**.

Final List would look like below:

#### List: [ 1, 4, 3, 8, 12, 10 ]
