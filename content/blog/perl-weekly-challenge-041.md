## TASK #1

***
***

### Write a script to display **attractive number** between 1 and 50.

> A number is an *attractive number* if the number of its prime factors is also prime number.

The number **20** is an **attractive number**, whose prime factors are **2**, **2** and **5**. The total prime factors is **3** which is also a **prime number**.

***

## TASK #2

***
***

### Write a script to display first 20 **Leonardo Numbers**. Please checkout [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_number) for more information.

For example:

##### L(0) = 1

##### L(1) = 1

##### L(2) = L(0) + L(1) + 1 = 3

##### L(3) = L(1) + L(2) + 1 = 5

and so on.
