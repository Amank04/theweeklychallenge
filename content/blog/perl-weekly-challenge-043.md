## HEADLINES

***
***

As you all know, **[Perl Careers](https://perl.careers/)** has been the sole sponsor for the **Weekly Champion** through out the year **2019**, we are very grateful to **Perl Careers** for the support. I have recently blogged ([**#1**](/blog/plan-2020) and [**#2**](/blog/merry-christmas-2019)) with regard to attract more sponsors for the **Weekly Champion**. I will let you know as and when I hear any update in this regard.

In the year **2020**, we decided to pick **Monthly Champion**, thanks to **Perl Careers**, once again for the support. We will pick one winner from all the contributors of the month. It will be announced on the first **Monday** of the following month. Therefore the winner of the **January 2020** would be declared on **February 3, 2020**. *All the best* Team PWC.

We would go back to **Weekly Champion** as soon as we find more sponsors. I believe, we are all in it for the love of our favourite language **Perl** and **Raku**. Having said that, we all like to be rewarded with gifts and appreciations. If you know anyone who would be willing to sponsor the winner then please let us know.

We have had many request in the past and recently as well with regard to change the challenge launch day i.e. move from **Monday** to **Saturday/Sunday**. We tried to hold this request for one reason, since **Saturday** and **Sunday** are the only off day we have where we do most of the management task. If we move the challenge launch day to either **Saturday** or **Sunday** then that would put us under immense work load. However, after discussing with one of the team member, we decided to create new club called **"Early Bird Club"**. Any existing member or new member can join the club by sending us one line request email to <perlweeklychallenge@yahoo.com>. From next **Sunday 19, 2017**, all members of **"Early Bird Club"** would get an early email notification with regard to the following week challenge. **Pull Request** solutions from the **"Early Bird Club"** members can only be accepted after the official launch of the weekly challenge. However they are **FREE** to submit their solutions by email anytime.

Last but not the least, we woud like to thank each and every member for their support and encouragement.

## TASK #1

### Olympic Rings

There are **5 rings** in the Olympic Logo as shown below. They are color coded as in **Blue**, **Black**, **Red**, **Yellow** and **Green**.

![Olympic Rings](/images/blog/olympic_rings.jpg)

We have allocated some numbers to these rings as below:

#### Blue: 8

#### Yellow: 7

#### Green: 5

#### Red: 9

The **Black** ring is empty currently. You are given the numbers **1, 2, 3, 4** and **6**. Write a script to place these numbers in the rings so that the sum of numbers in each ring is exactly **11**.

## TASK #2

### Self-descriptive Numbers

##### Contributed by Laurent Rosenfeld

Write a script to generate **Self-descriptive Numbers** in a given base.

> In mathematics, a self-descriptive number is an integer m that in a given base b is b digits long in which each digit d at position n (the most significant digit being at position 0 and the least significant at position b - 1) counts how many instances of digit n are in m.

For example, if the given base is **10**, then script should print **6210001000**. For more information, please checkout [**wiki page**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-descriptive_number).
