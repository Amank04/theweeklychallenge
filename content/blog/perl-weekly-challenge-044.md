## HEADLINES

***
***

Last week was really upsetting for me, I had call from my brother (India) telling me that Dad is unwell and currently admitted in **ICU**. I made quick arrangement and flew to India last Friday. I met my Dad the next day at the hospital. It was an emotional re-union of Father & Son. I am planning to stay with him for a week and flying back coming Sunday. In all of these, I tried to find time to get as much covered as possible. Apology if you find things not in place this week and following week.

Last but not the least, we woud like to thank each and every member for their support and encouragement.

### Make it $200

You have only $1 left at the start of the week. You have been given an opportunity to make it $200. The rule is simple with every move you can either **double** what you have or add another $1. Write a script to help you get $200 with the smallest number of moves.
