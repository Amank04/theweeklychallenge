Apology to all team members, the **Weekly Challenge** is still not on the track. Things have improved but there is still a lot to do. I am pleasantly suprised by the offer of help by all the team members. **Ryan Thompson** offered to do **Perl Reviews**, which is a big help. I will now have one less thing to worry about every week. Thanks **Ryan Thompson**.

**Saif Ahmed** created a very hand tool [**EZPWC**](https://github.com/saiftynet/EZPWC). This is going to help you streamline the process of submitting solutions to **Weekly Challenge**. Please do provide your feedback/suggestions.

I know, I haven't forgotten about the monthly winner. It is time to pick our first winner of year 2020. We declare **Wanderdoc** as our first monthly winner for the month **January 2020**. Congratulations **Wanderdoc**, keep contributing and inspiring us.

Last but not the least, we woud like to thank each and every member for their support and encouragement.

## TASK #1

***
***

### Cryptic Message

The communication system of an office is broken and message received are not completely reliable. To send message **Hello**, it ended up sending these following:

    H x l 4 !
    c e - l o
    z e 6 l g
    H W l v R
    q 9 m # o

Similary another day we received a message repeatedly like below:

    P + 2 l ! a t o
    1 e 8 0 R $ 4 u
    5 - r ] + a > /
    P x w l b 3 k \
    2 e 3 5 R 8 y u
    < ! r ^ ( ) k 0

Write a script to decrypt the above repeated message (one message repeated 6 times).

#### HINT: Look for characters repeated in a particular position in all six messages received.

## TASK #2

### Is the room open?

There are 500 rooms in a hotel with 500 employees having keys to all the rooms. The first employee opened main entrance door of all the rooms. The second employee then closed the doors of room numbers 2,4,6,8,10 and so on to 500. The third employee then closed the door if it was opened or opened the door if it was closed of rooms 3,6,9,12,15 and so on to 500. Similarly the fourth employee did the same as the third but only room numbers 4,8,12,16 and so on to 500. This goes on until all employees has had a turn.

Write a script to find out all the rooms still open at the end.
