## HEADLINES

***

We are pleased to announce that we have found **Raku Reviewer** to cover the temporary break by **Laurent Rosenfeld**. Any guess? He is the coolest kid in the team, **Ryan Thompson**. I would like to mention another gem from the team, **Ulrich Rieke**, who is a star contributor. He has been contributing regularly in **Perl**, **Raku**, **C++** and **Haskell**.

You must have noticed there is a fixed set of members who blog about their solutions every week. There are handful who blogs occassionally. Last week, **Noud Aldenhoven**, felt the solution to the **Task #2** needed to be blog about. Hence, he [**blogged**](https://www.noudaldenhoven.nl/wordpress/?p=288) for the first time.

I have been thinking of taking part in the weekly challenge for a long time but couldn't do it because of lack of time. The wait is finally over, I have now shared my [**first contributions**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-046/mohammad-anwar/perl). I must make it clear that I wont be taking part in **Monthly Winner** competition.

Last but not the least, I woud like to thank each and every member for their support and encouragement.
