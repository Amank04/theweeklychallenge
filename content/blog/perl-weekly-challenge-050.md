## TASK #1

***
***

### Merge Intervals

***

Write a script to merge the given intervals where ever possible.

> [2,7], [3,9], [10,12], [15,19], [18,22]

The script should merge **[2, 7]** and **[3, 9]** together to return **[2, 9]**.

Similarly it should also merge **[15, 19]** and **[18, 22]** together to return **[15, 22]**.

The final result should be something like below:

> [2, 9], [10, 12], [15, 22]

## TASK #2

##### Contributed by Ryan Thompson.

***
***

### Noble Integer

***

You are given a list, `@L`, of three or more random integers between 1 and 50. A Noble Integer is an integer *N* in `@L`, such that there are exactly *N* integers greater than *N* in `@L`. Output any Noble Integer found in `@L`, or an empty list if none were found.

An interesting question is whether or not there can be multiple Noble Integers in a list.

For example,

Suppose we have list of **4** integers **[2, 6, 1, 3]**.

Here we have **2** in the above list, known as **Noble Integer**, since there are exactly **2** integers in the list i.e.**3** and **6**, which are greater than **2**.

Therefore the script would print **2**.
