## HEADLINES

We are close to completing one year of weekly challenge. I am sure you would all agree, in this journey we have come across many experts in **Perl** and **Raku**. If you know of any **Perl**/**Raku** opportunities at your work place then please let us know about it. Similary if any member looking for any opportunities can reach out to us. We would then pass the contact details for you to take it further.

Few days ago, our current **Perl** and **Raku** reviewer, **Ryan Thompson**, contacted us and informed that this week review is going to be delayed because of **Family Emergency**. We pray and wish that things get better soon and we have our **Ryan** back.

Last but not the least, I woud like to thank each and every member for their support and encouragement.

## TASK #1

***
***

### 3 Sum

***

Given an array `@L`of integers. Write a script to find all unique **triplets** such that **a + b + c** is same as the given target `T`. Also make sure **a <= b <= c**.

Here is **[wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3SUM)** for more information.

Example:

>    @L = (-25, -10, -7, -3, 2, 4, 8, 10);

One such triplet for target `0` i.e. **-10 + 2 + 8 = 0**.

***
***

## TASK #2

***
***

### Colourful Number

***

Write a script to display all **Colorful Number** with 3 digits.

> A number can be declare **Colorful Number** where all the products of consecutive subsets of digit are different.

For example, **263** is a **Colorful Number** since **2, 6, 3, 2x6, 6x3, 2x6x3** are unique.
