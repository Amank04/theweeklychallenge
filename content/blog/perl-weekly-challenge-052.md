## HEADLINES

A friend of mine, **[Jeff Goff (@DrForr)](https://twitter.com/DrForr)** sadly killed in a scuba-diving accident while on vacation few days ago. I have known him for many years, mostly got to attend his talk at **London Perl Workshop**. I still remember his talk **["The Art of Programming"](http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2017/talk/7257)**. It was a very different experience where audience got to play with piece of paper during the entire talk. I only got the opportunity to have one-2-one conversation with him at **The Perl Conference in Riga** last year. I even had the pleasure to go to dinner with him one day during the conference. He was a gem of a person. He even contributed to **[CPAN](https://metacpan.org/author/JGOFF)**. He would always encourage me, no matter what. Every time I post something on **Twitter/Facebook**, he would be the first to like or comment. He would always help me with **Raku** questions on **Twitter**.

> May his soul rest in peace

**COVID-19** seems to have taken the focus away from **"The Weekly Challenge"** last week. I have had few members sharing they couldn't focus on weekly challenge because of **COVID-19** pandemic. Even **London** has been affected badly. I hope things will get better soon. Please look after yourself and your family. Stay indoor and stay safe. For me, reading your contributions worked like a therapy. It helped me to forget about everything. Also doing the weekly challenge also helped me avoid watching news about the pandemic.

We are looking for volunteer to help us with **Raku Reviews**. So far, **Laurent Rosenfeld** and **Ryan Thompson** have done brilliant job with **[quality reviews](/p6-reviews)**. Their reviews have been appreciated by each and every member of **Team PWC**. We would be grateful if you could help us with reviews. Please let us know if you would like to be part of elite team of reviewers.

Last but not the least, I woud like to thank each and every member for their support and encouragement.
