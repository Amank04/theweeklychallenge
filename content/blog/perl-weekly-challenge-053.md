## TASK #1

### Rotate Matrix

***

Write a script to rotate the followin matrix by given **90/180/270 degrees** clockwise.

    [ 1, 2, 3 ]
    [ 4, 5, 6 ]
    [ 7, 8, 9 ]

For example, if you rotate by **90 degrees** then expected result should be like below

    [ 7, 4, 1 ]
    [ 8, 5, 2 ]
    [ 9, 6, 3 ]

## TASK #2

***
***

### Vowel Strings

Write a script to accept an integer **1 <= N <= 5** that would print all possible strings of size **N** formed by using only vowels (**a, e, i, o, u**).

The string should follow the following rules:

1. **'a’** can only be followed by **‘e’** and **‘i’**.

2. **‘e’** can only be followed by **‘i’**.

3. **‘i’** can only be followed by **‘a’**, **‘e’**, **‘o’**, and **‘u’**.

4. **‘o’** can only be followed by **‘a’** and **‘u’**.

5. **‘u’** can only be followed by **‘o’** and **‘e’**.

For example, if the given integer **N = 2** then script should print the following strings:

    ae
    ai
    ei
    ia
    io
    iu
    ie
    oa
    ou
    uo
    ue
