## TASK #1

***
***

### Diff-K

***
***

You are given an array **@N** of positive integers (sorted) and another non negative integer **k**.

Write a script to find if there exists 2 indices **i** and **j** such that **A[i] - A[j] = k** and **i != j**.

It should print the pairs of indices, if any such pairs exist.

Example:

        @N = (2, 7, 9)
        $k = 2

Output : 2,1

## TASK #2

***
***

### Path Sum

***

You are given a binary tree and a sum, write a script to find if the tree has a path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum. Only complete paths (from root to leaf node) may be considered for a sum.

#### Example

Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,

              5
             / \
            4   8
           /   / \
          11  13  9
         /  \      \
        7    2      1

For the given binary tree, the partial path sum **5 → 8 → 9 = 22** is **not** valid.

The script should return the path **5 → 4 → 11 → 2** whose sum is **22**.
