## HEADLINES

***

Last week, we had the opportunity to speak to the **Perl Weekly Champion** of last month, **[Alicia Bielsa](/blog/meet-the-champion-2020-03)**. I would like to share the relationship between **Perl Weekly Challenge** and **[Perl Weekly Newsletter](https://perlweekly.com/)**. I have been associated with **Perl Weekly Newsletter** since **May 2018** as **Co-Editor**. The name **Perl Weekly Challenge** was naturally inspired by the **Perl Weekly Newsletter**. The Chief Editor, **Gabor Szabo** has been a big supporter of **Perl Weekly Challenge**. He has given us permanent space in his widely read and the most popular newsletter. I would like to thank, **Elizabeth Mattijsen**, creator of **[Rakudo Weekly Newsletter](https://rakudoweekly.blog/)**, for giving us regular space in the weekly newsletter.

As you all know, I have been taking part in the weekly challenge regularly and using the opportunity to learn **Raku**. It has been great experience so far. Thanks to the army of **Raku Experts** readily available to answer any questions I have. Why not you also throw your questions at them? They are available **24x7** on the Twitter platform `@PerlWChallenge`.

Last but not the least, I woud like to thank each and every member for their support and encouragement.

## TASK #1 › Invert Tree

***

You are given a [full binary tree](https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~sheard/course/Cs163/Doc/FullvsComplete.html) of any height, similar to the one below:

<img src="/images/blog/pwc-057-1.svg" width=300 />

Write a script to **invert** the tree, by mirroring the children of every node, from left to right. The expected output from the tree above would be:

<img src="/images/blog/pwc-057-2.svg" width=300 />

The input can be any sensible machine-readable binary tree format of your choosing, and the output should be the same format.

### BONUS

*In addition* to the above, you may wish to pretty-print your binary tree in a human readable text-based format similar to the following:

```
       1
      /  \
     3    2
    / \  / \
   7   6 5  4

```

## TASK #2 › Shortest Unique Prefix

***

Write a script to find the **shortest unique prefix** for each each word in the given list. The prefixes will not necessarily be of the same length.

### Sample Input

        [ "alphabet", "book", "carpet", "cadmium", "cadeau", "alpine" ]

### Expected Output

        [ "alph", "b", "car", "cadm", "cade", "alpi" ]
