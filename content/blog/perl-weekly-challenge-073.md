## TASK #1 › Min Sliding Window
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers `@A` and sliding window size `$S`.

Write a script to create an array of min from each sliding window.

## Example

### Input: @A = (1, 5, 0, 2, 9, 3, 7, 6, 4, 8) and $S = 3
### Output: (0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4)

<br>

#### [(1 5 0) 2 9 3 7 6 4 8] = Min (0)
#### [1 (5 0 2) 9 3 7 6 4 8] = Min (0)
#### [1 5 (0 2 9) 3 7 6 4 8] = Min (0)
#### [1 5 0 (2 9 3) 7 6 4 8] = Min (2)
#### [1 5 0 2 (9 3 7) 6 4 8] = Min (3)
#### [1 5 0 2 9 (3 7 6) 4 8] = Min (3)
#### [1 5 0 2 9 3 (7 6 4) 8] = Min (4)
#### [1 5 0 2 9 3 7 (6 4 8)] = Min (4)

<br>

***
## TASK #2 › Smallest Neighbour
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers `@A`.

Write a script to create an array that represents the smallest element to the left of each corresponding index. If none found then use 0.

## Example 1

### Input: @A = (7, 8, 3, 12, 10)
### Output: (0, 7, 0, 3, 3)

<br>

#### For index 0, the smallest number to the left of $A[0] i.e. 7 is none, so we put 0.
#### For index 1, the smallest number to the left of $A[1] as compare to 8, in (7) is 7 so we put 7.
#### For index 2, the smallest number to the left of $A[2] as compare to 3, in (7, 8) is none, so we put 0.
#### For index 3, the smallest number to the left of $A[3] as compare to 12, in (7, 8, 3) is 3, so we put 3.
#### For index 4, the smallest number to the left of $A[4] as compare to 10, in (7, 8, 3, 12) is 3, so we put 3 again.

<br>

## Example 2

### Input: @A = (4, 6, 5)
### Output: (0, 4, 4)

<br>

#### For index 0, the smallest number to the left of $A[0] is none, so we put 0.
#### For index 1, the smallest number to the left of $A[1] as compare to 6, in (4) is 4, so we put 4.
#### For index 2, the smallest number to the left of $A[2] as compare to 5, in (4, 6) is 4, so we put 4 again.
