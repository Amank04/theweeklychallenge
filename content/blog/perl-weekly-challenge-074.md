## HEADLINES

***

The **week #072** was full of pleasant surprises, one of them was getting past **100** contributions. The whole **Team PWC** needs a big round of applause. Having set the target so high, the following **week #073** was under pressure to perform. Honestly speaking, it was me who wanted to get somewhere close to the peak if not beat the previous high.

To keep the followers of [@PerlWChallenge](https://twitter.com/PerlWChallenge) up to date, I kept sharing the progress during the week. By midweek, we crossed **50+** but still not there. By Friday, we went past **70+**. On Sunday evening we actually crossed the **100** mark. So technically, we have done it twice in a row. It only happened once in the past when we did it twice in a row (**week #001** and **week #002**).

<br>

# What next?

<br>

I really want to beat and not just match the previous record of 2 in a row. So I hope **Team PWC** would not let me down. Lets create the history in the **week #074** and go past **100** one more time.

I must make this clear that we don't count the guest contributions towards the target. We only count **Perl** and **Raku** contributions along with any blogs and videos. Having said that I am impressed with the choice of languages we received solutions in. There are plenty to keep you busy all week. You have so much to learn from these contributions. I personally thank all the guests for their support.

I would like to specially mention, **Lance Wicks**, a dear friend of mine, for the [live streaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA7dCY7vDJo) of weekly challenge.

Lets talk about the guest contributions this week. We had **17 contributions** in **8 different** languages as listed below:

#### 4) Python: 2 ([Lubos Kolouch](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-073/lubos-kolouch/python))
#### 5) Ruby: 2 ([Shawak](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-073/shawak/ruby))
#### 6) Swift: 2 ([Mohammad S Anwar](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-073/mohammad-anwar/swift))
#### 7) Tcl: 2 ([Shawn Wagner](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-073/shawn-wagner/tcl))
#### 8) Rust: 1 ([Jonas Berlin](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-073/xkr47/rust))

<br>

# Did you notice a new name in the list above?

<br>

Well, **Shawn Wagner**, joined the team last week and in the first week itself he joined the guest list with contributions in **Tcl**.

**Jonas Berlin** came back after a long break to be part of the guest list with his contribution in **Rust**. In the past he shared solutions in **Raku** only. While talking about comebacks, I would like to mention another name, **Lubos Kolouch**, who have contributed in **Perl** and **Python** regularly in the past. **Shawak** is another guest who made a comeback with contributions in **Ruby**.

<br>

While we are talking about contributions, lets share some interesting stats from [**GitHub**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club).

#### 1) Commits: 8538
#### 2) Pull Requests: 2085

## TASK #1 › Majority Element
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers of size `$N`.

Write a script to find the majority element. If none found then print -1.

>   Majority element in the list is the one that appears more than floor(size_of_list/2).

## Example 1

#### Input: @A = (1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2)
#### Output: 2, as 2 appears 4 times in the list which is more than floor(7/2).

<br>

## Example 2

#### Input: @A = (1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5)
#### Output: -1 as none of the elements appears more than floor(6/2).

<br>

***
## TASK #2 › FNR Character
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a string `$S`.

Write a script to print the series of first non-repeating character for the given string. Print `#` if none found.

## Example 1

#### Input: $S = 'ababc'
#### Output: 'abb#c'

##### Pass 1: "a",    the FNR character is 'a'
##### Pass 2: "ab",   the FNR character is 'b'
##### Pass 3: "aba",  the FNR character is 'b'
##### Pass 4: "abab", no FNR found, hence  '#'
##### Pass 5: "ababc" the FNR character is 'c'

<br>

## Example 2

#### Input: $S = 'xyzzyx'
#### Output: 'xyzyx#'

##### Pass 1: "x",      the FNR character is "x"
##### Pass 2: "xy",     the FNR character is "y"
##### Pass 3: "xyz",    the FNR character is "z"
##### Pass 4: "xyzz",   the FNR character is "y"
##### Pass 5: "xyzzy",  the FNR character is "x"
##### Pass 6: "xyzzyx", no FNR found, hence  '#'
