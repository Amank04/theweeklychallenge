## Well done Team PWC, we did it.

<br>

It took us **74 weeks** to break the record of **2 consecutive** weeks of **100+ contributions**. Just to remind you it was right at the start, **Week #001** and **Week #002**. In between we did manage to cross the magical number but never once crossed **3 in a row**.

<br>

#### 1) Week #001: 142
#### 2) Week #002: 109
#### 3) Week #030: 115
#### 4) Week #033: 108
#### 5) Week #046: 106
#### 6) Week #072: 109
#### 7) Week #073: 108
#### 8) Week #074: 110

<br>

Having done this now, we should now aim to break the record of maximum contributions in a week. We have two targets to break, first `115` and then `142`. We did come very close to `115` though. Never mind, lets take this challenge and don't forget to have fun. We have enough members to easily break the record in theory. Even half of the total members (`182`) contribute **2 each**, we can easily beat the all time record.

I really wanted to give each and every members a small token of gift who made this possible in the last **3 weeks**. Unfortunately we don't have any fund to support at the moment. But I promise, as and when we find a sponsor, I would definitely share equally among all members who took part in the marathon.

To be honest, I was little nervous on **Sunday** morning. But the contributions keep coming in bulk. By **8 pm UK time**, we crossed the magic number. Since it doesn't take into account of guest contributions, let me share another achievements by **Team PWC**. We beat the previous best of **19 contributions** in **9 different** languages in the **Week #073**. This week we have **28 contributions** in **10 different** languagees. So this week will remain very special for many reasons. I would like to **THANK**, each and every guest contributors.

#### 1) Python: 6
#### 2) C++: 5
#### 3) Haskell: 3
#### 4) APL: 2
#### 5) Clojure: 2
#### 6) Elm: 2
#### 7) Java: 2
#### 8) Lisp: 2
#### 9) Swift: 2
#### 10) Tcl: 2

<br>

While we are talking about contributions, lets share some interesting stats from [**GitHub**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club).

#### 1) Commits: 8726
#### 2) Pull Requests: 2130
#### 3) Fork: 147
#### 4) Stars: 70

<br>

Last but not the least, I would like to thank each and every member for their support and encouragement.

## TASK #1 › Coins Sum
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a set of coins `@C`, assuming you have infinite amount of each coin in the set.

Write a script to find how many ways you make sum `$S` using the coins from the set `@C`.

## Example:

    Input:
        @C = (1, 2, 4)
        $S = 6

    Output: 6
    There are 6 possible ways to make sum 6.
    a) (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
    b) (1, 1, 1, 1, 2)
    c) (1, 1, 2, 2)
    d) (1, 1, 4)
    e) (2, 2, 2)
    f) (2, 4)

## TASK #2 › Largest Rectangle Histogram
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of positive numbers `@A`.

Write a script to find the largest rectangle histogram created by the given array.

#### BONUS: Try to print the histogram as shown in the example, if possible.

<br>

## Example 1:

<br>

#### Input: @A = (2, 1, 4, 5, 3, 7)

         7           #
         6           #
         5       #   #
         4     # #   #
         3     # # # #
         2 #   # # # #
         1 # # # # # #
         _ _ _ _ _ _ _
           2 1 4 5 3 7

Looking at the above histogram, the largest rectangle (4 x 3) is formed by columns (4, 5, 3 and 7).

#### Output: 12

***

<br>

## Example 2:

<br>

#### Input: @A = (3, 2, 3, 5, 7, 5)

         7         #
         6         #
         5       # # #
         4       # # #
         3 #   # # # #
         2 # # # # # #
         1 # # # # # #
         _ _ _ _ _ _ _
           3 2 3 5 7 5

Looking at the above histogram, the largest rectangle (3 x 5) is formed by columns (5, 7 and 5).

#### Output: 15
