## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

**Team PWC**, you did it once again. Congratulations to each and every member. We have now created a record of **4 consecutive** weeks of **100+ contributions**. I wasn't hopeful of breaking at the end of **Friday** looking at the numbers to be honest. But for some reason, I knew weekends might create magic.

I am tired and exhausted now after the marathon of **4 weeks**. Havind said that I know I will be back with full energy in couple of days again.

<br>

#### 1) Week #001: 142
#### 2) Week #002: 109

<br>

Last week, we had guest contributions in **10** different languages. We beat that record as well as we have contributions in **11** different languages this week. Two new languages added to the list i.e. **OCaml** and **Gembase**. I would like to **THANK** each and every guest contributors.

## NEW MEMBERS {#NEWMEMBERS}

***

#### [Alex Mauney](https://github.com/mathmauney), an experienced Perl hacker.
#### [Alexander Pankoff](https://github.com/ccntrq), an experienced Perl hacker from Hannover, Germany.

> I started using Perl professionally and recreationally around 5 years ago. I also work with TypeScript and use Haskell for hobby projects.

#### [Tyler Wardhaugh](https://github.com/tylerw)

> I've been using Perl for a long time, on and off. Mostly Perl 5, but I have followed Raku development from afar. I've been using Clojure for a few years for personal projects and would like to do "guest" submissions in that to improve my skills in it. I notice you have Common Lisp, but no Clojure.

<br>

With the above addition, we now have **184 members** in the **Team PWC**.

Please find out [**How to contribute?**](/blog/how-to-contribute), if you have any doubts.

Please give it a try to an excellent tool [**EZPWC**](https://github.com/saiftynet/EZPWC) created by respected member **Saif Ahmed** of **Team PWC**.

## TASK #1 › Prime Sum {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
##### **Reviewed by:** [Ryan Thompson](https://ry.ca)
***

You are given a number `$N`. Write a script to find the minimum number of prime numbers required, whose summation gives you `$N`.

For the sake of this task, please assume `1` is not a prime number.

## Example:

    Input:
        $N = 9

    Ouput:
        2 as sum of 2 prime numbers i.e. 2 and 7 is same as the input number.
        2 + 7 = 9.

<br>

***
## TASK #2 › Word Search {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Neil Bowers](http://neilb.org)
##### **Reviewed by:** [Ryan Thompson](https://ry.ca)
***

Write a script that takes two file names. The first file would contain word search grid as shown below. The second file contains list of words, one word per line. You could even use local dictionary file.

Print out a list of all words seen on the grid, looking both orthogonally and diagonally, backwards as well as forwards.

## Search Grid

```
B I D E M I A T S U C C O R S T
L D E G G I W Q H O D E E H D P
U S E I R U B U T E A S L A G U
N G N I Z I L A I C O S C N U D
T G M I D S T S A R A R E I F G
S R E N M D C H A S I V E E L I
S C S H A E U E B R O A D M T E
H W O V L P E D D L A I U L S S
R Y O N L A S F C S T A O G O T
I G U S S R R U G O V A R Y O C
N R G P A T N A N G I L A M O O
E I H A C E I V I R U S E S E D
S E T S U D T T G A R L I C N H
H V R M X L W I U M S N S O T B
A E A O F I L C H T O D C A E U
Z S C D F E C A A I I R L N R F
A R I I A N Y U T O O O U T P F
R S E C I S N A B O S C N E R A
D R S M P C U U N E L T E S I L
```

## Output

Found 54 words of length 5 or more when checked against the local dictionary. You may or may not get the same result but that is fine.

aimed, align, antes, argos, arose, ashed, blunt, blunts, broad, buries, clove, cloven, constitution, constitutions, croon, depart, departed, enter, filch, garlic, goats, grieve, grieves, hazard, liens, malign, malignant, malls, margo, midst, ought, ovary, parted, patna, pudgiest, quash, quashed, raped, ruses, shrine, shrines, social, socializing, spasm, spasmodic, succor, succors, theorem, theorems, traci, tracie, virus, viruses, wigged
