**Luca Ferrari**, one of the most dedicated member of **Team PWC** shared this news with us in his **[last blog](https://fluca1978.github.io/2020/08/31/PerlWeeklyChallenge76.html)**.

> On the very next monday, September 7th, I will be in hospital for a new surgery on my (last) working right eye. In particular, I will be doing a trabeculectomy, and I’m pretty sure I will not be able to see anything for a couple of weeks, may be more. I hope my brain is not going to fail in the meantime!

This is heart breaking news. He has been regularly sharing the updates recently. I pray for his quick recovery.

It also reminds me of my own experience. Some of you might know about my eye sight trouble. The vision in my right eye is completely blurred, I noticed this just 2 weeks after my wedding, **17 years** ago. I was told the damage is permanent and nothing can be done about it. It was very difficult moment for my wife. I somehow adjusted to the life with just one eye. Seven years later after that, I noticed it started affecting my other eye as well. I was put on high dose of steriod. I was on steriod for 3 years. As of today, I can't see anything from my right eye. Left eye vision is slightly blurred but good enough for me to carry on routine work. I know how hard it must be for Luca and his family.

I pray for him and hope we get to hear good news soon.

I realised it is the first **Monday** of the month and time to declare the champion. With great pleasure, I announce **Cheok-Yin Fung** as the next champion. She joined the **Team PWC** in the **Week #044** and has never missed a week since then. She is currently ranked **#24** with contributions **Perl: 60** and **Blog: 19**.

After **4 busy weeks**, it was relatively quiet week. It was something expected. I also struggled with **Word Search** task. Somehow I got a working solution in **[Perl](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-076/mohammad-anwar/perl/ch-2.pl)** and **[Raku](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-076/mohammad-anwar/raku/ch-2.raku)**. Looking at others solution, for example, **[Neil Bowers](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-076/neil-bowers/perl/ch-2.pl)**, I feel like hiding under the blanket. I don't have courage to face the world after the rubbish work I came up with. Having said that, I learnt a lot from others solutions. At one point, I decided not to share and embarrass myself. The only grace was my solution to the **Prime Sum** task in **[Perl](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-076/mohammad-anwar/perl/ch-1.pl)** and **[Raku](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-076/mohammad-anwar/raku/ch-1.raku)**. I am just hoping that I don't get the beating by the reviewers **Colin Crain** and **Andrew Shitov**.

**Dave Cross**, an esteemed member of **Team PWC** wrote a **[blog](https://dev.to/davorg/learn-enough-git-and-github-to-take-part-in-the-perl-weekly-challenge-gpm)** about **Git/GitHub** to help new members joining the weekly challenge.

## TASK #1 › Fibonacci Sum {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a positive integer $N.

Write a script to find the total number of Fibonacci Numbers required to get $N on addition. You are NOT allowed to repeat a number. Print 0 if none found.

## Example 1:

    Input: $N = 6

    Output: 3 as (1 + 2 + 3 = 6)

## Example 2:

    Input: $N = 9

    Output: 2 as (1 + 8 = 9)

<br>

## TASK #2 › Lonely X {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given `m x n` character matrix consists of `O` and `X` only.

Write a script to count the total number of `X` surrounded by `O` only. Print `0` if none found.

## Example 1:

    Input: [ O O X ]
           [ X 0 0 ]
           [ X 0 0 ]

    Output: 1 as there is only one X at the first row last column surrounded by only O.

## Example 2:

    Input: [ O O X 0 ]
           [ X 0 0 O ]
           [ X 0 0 X ]
           [ 0 X O 0 ]

    Output: 2

        a) First  X found at Row 1 Col 3.

        b) Second X found at Row 3 Col 4.
