Did you notice any changes to the website?

I have been making small changes to make the user interface more friendly.

You must have guessed it by now that I am not a designer. I am trying to the best of my capability.

There is one hurdle that I face every time I try to make any interface change is the lack of knowledge of `Go Lang`.

I am using **Hugo** static site builder. In the past, `Ryan Thompson` helped me with it.

Last but not the least, I would like to thank each and every member for their support and encouragement.

## TASK #1 â€º Count Set Bits {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a positive number `$N`.

Write a script to count the total numbrer of set bits of the binary representations of all numbers from `1` to `$N` and return `$total_count_set_bit % 1000000007`.

## Example 1:

    Input: $N = 4

    Explanation: First find out the set bit counts of all numbers i.e. 1, 2, 3 and 4.

        Decimal: 1
        Binary: 001
        Set Bit Counts: 1

        Decimal: 2
        Binary: 010
        Set Bit Counts: 1

        Decimal: 3
        Binary: 011
        Set Bit Counts: 2

        Decimal: 4
        Binary: 100
        Set Bit Counts: 1

        Total set bit count: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5

    Output: Your script should print `5` as `5 % 1000000007 = 5`.

## Example 2:

    Input: $N = 3

    Explanation: First find out the set bit counts of all numbers i.e. 1, 2 and 3.

        Decimal: 1
        Binary: 01
        Set Bit Count: 1

        Decimal: 2
        Binary: 10
        Set Bit Count: 1

        Decimal: 3
        Binary: 11
        Set Bit Count: 2

        Total set bit count: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4

    Output: Your script should print `4` as `4 % 1000000007 = 4`.

## TASK #2 â€º Trapped Rain Water {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of positive numbers `@N`.

Write a script to represent it as Histogram Chart and find out how much water it can trap.

## Example 1:

#### Input: @N = (2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 5)

#### The histogram representation of the given array is as below.

         5           #
         4     #     #
         3     #     #
         2 #   #   # #
         1 # # # # # #
         _ _ _ _ _ _ _
           2 1 4 1 2 5

Looking at the above histogram, we can see, it can trap `1 unit` of rain water between 1st and 3rd column. Similary it can trap `5 units` of rain water betweem 3rd and last column.

Therefore your script should print `6`.

## Example 2:

#### Input: @N = (3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5)

#### The histogram representation of the given array is as below.

         5           #
         4           #
         3 #   #     #
         2 #   #     #
         1 # # # # # #
         _ _ _ _ _ _ _
           3 1 3 1 1 5

Looking at the above histogram, we can see, it can trap `2 units` of rain water between 1st and 3rd column. Also it can trap `4 units` of rain water between 3rd and last column.

Therefore your script should print `6`.
