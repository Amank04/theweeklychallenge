## TASK #1 › Common Base String {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given 2 strings, `$A` and `$B`.

Write a script to find out common base strings in `$A` and `$B`.

> A substring of a string `$S` is called base string if repeated concatenation of the substring results in the string.

## Example 1:

    Input:
        $A = "abcdabcd"
        $B = "abcdabcdabcdabcd"

    Output:
        ("abcd", "abcdabcd")

## Example 2:

    Input:
        $A = "aaa"
        $B = "aa"

    Output:
        ("a")

<br>

***
## TASK #2 › Frequency Sort {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given file named `input`.

Write a script to find the frequency of all the words.

It should print the result as first column of each line should be the frequency of the the word followed by all the words of that frequency arranged in lexicographical order. Also sort the words in the ascending order of frequency.

#### INPUT file

    West Side Story

    The award-winning adaptation of the classic romantic tragedy "Romeo and Juliet". The feuding families become two warring New York City gangs, the white Jets led by Riff and the Latino Sharks, led by Bernardo. Their hatred escalates to a point where neither can coexist with any form of understanding. But when Riff's best friend (and former Jet) Tony and Bernardo's younger sister Maria meet at a dance, no one can do anything to stop their love. Maria and Tony begin meeting in secret, planning to run away. Then the Sharks and Jets plan a rumble under the highway--whoever wins gains control of the streets. Maria sends Tony to stop it, hoping it can end the violence. It goes terribly wrong, and before the lovers know what's happened, tragedy strikes and doesn't stop until the climactic and heartbreaking ending.
