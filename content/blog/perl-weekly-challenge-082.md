## TASK #1 › Common Factors {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Niels van Dijke](https://github.com/PerlBoy1967)
***

You are given 2 positive numbers `$M` and `$N`.

Write a script to list all common factors of the given numbers.

## Example 1:

    Input:
        $M = 12
        $N = 18

    Output:
        (1, 2, 3, 6)

    Explanation:
        Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
        Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9

## Example 2:

    Input:
        $M = 18
        $N = 23

    Output:
        (1)

    Explanation:
        Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
        Factors of 23: 1

## TASK #2 › Interleave String {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given 3 strings; `$A`, `$B` and `$C`.

Write a script to check if `$C` is created by interleave `$A` and `$B`.

Print `1` if check is success otherwise `0`.

## Example 1:

    Input:
        $A = "XY"
        $B = "X"
        $C = "XXY"

    Output: 1

### EXPLANATION

    "X" (from $B) + "XY" (from $A) = $C

## Example 2:

    Input:
        $A = "XXY"
        $B = "XXZ"
        $C = "XXXXZY"

    Output: 1

### EXPLANATION

    "XX" (from $A) + "XXZ" (from $B) + "Y" (from $A) = $C


## Example 3:

    Input:
        $A = "YX"
        $B = "X"
        $C = "XXY"

    Output: 0
