## TASK #1 › Reverse Integer {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an integer `$N`.

Write a script to reverse the given integer and print the result. Print 0 if the result doesn't fit in 32-bit signed integer.

The number `2,147,483,647` is the maximum positive value for a 32-bit signed binary integer in computing.

## Example 1:

    Input: 1234
    Output: 4321

## Example 2:

    Input: -1234
    Output: -4321

## Example 3:

    Input: 1231230512
    Output: 0

## TASK #2 › Find Square {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given matrix of size `m x n` with only `1` and `0`.

Write a script to find the count of squares having all four corners set as `1`.

## Example 1:

    Input: [ 0 1 0 1 ]
           [ 0 0 1 0 ]
           [ 1 1 0 1 ]
           [ 1 0 0 1 ]

    Output: 1

### Explanation:
#### There is one square (3x3) in the given matrix with four corners as 1 starts at r=1;c=2.

    [ 1 0 1 ]
    [ 0 1 0 ]
    [ 1 0 1 ]

## Example 2:

    Input: [ 1 1 0 1 ]
           [ 1 1 0 0 ]
           [ 0 1 1 1 ]
           [ 1 0 1 1 ]

    Output: 4

### Explanation:

#### There is one square (4x4) in the given matrix with four corners as 1 starts at r=1;c=1.
#### There is one square (3x3) in the given matrix with four corners as 1 starts at r=1;c=2.
#### There are two squares (2x2) in the given matrix with four corners as 1. First starts at r=1;c=1 and second starts at r=3;c=3.

## Example 3:

    Input: [ 0 1 0 1 ]
           [ 1 0 1 0 ]
           [ 0 1 0 0 ]
           [ 1 0 0 1 ]

    Output: 0
