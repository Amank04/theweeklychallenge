## TASK #1 › Pair Difference {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers `@N` and an integer `$A`.

Write a script to find find if there exists a pair of elements in the array whose difference is `$A`.

Print `1` if exists otherwise `0`.

## Example 1:

    Input: @N = (10, 8, 12, 15, 5) and $A = 7
    Output: 1 as 15 - 8 = 7

## Example 2:

    Input: @N = (1, 5, 2, 9, 7) and $A = 6
    Output: 1 as 7 - 1 = 6

## Example 3:

    Input: @N = (10, 30, 20, 50, 40) and $A = 15
    Output: 0

## TASK #2 › Sudoku Puzzle {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given Sudoku puzzle (9x9).

Write a script to complete the puzzle and must respect the following rules:

##### a) Each row must have the numbers 1-9 occuring just once.
##### b) Each column must have the numbers 1-9 occuring just once.
##### c) The numbers 1-9 must occur just once in each of the 9 sub-boxes (3x3) of the grid.

## Example:

    [ _ _ _ 2 6 _ 7 _ 1 ]
    [ 6 8 _ _ 7 _ _ 9 _ ]
    [ 1 9 _ _ _ 4 5 _ _ ]
    [ 8 2 _ 1 _ _ _ 4 _ ]
    [ _ _ 4 6 _ 2 9 _ _ ]
    [ _ 5 _ _ _ 3 _ 2 8 ]
    [ _ _ 9 3 _ _ _ 7 4 ]
    [ _ 4 _ _ 5 _ _ 3 6 ]
    [ 7 _ 3 _ 1 8 _ _ _ ]

## Output:

    [ 4 3 5 2 6 9 7 8 1 ]
    [ 6 8 2 5 7 1 4 9 3 ]
    [ 1 9 7 8 3 4 5 6 2 ]
    [ 8 2 6 1 9 5 3 4 7 ]
    [ 3 7 4 6 8 2 9 1 5 ]
    [ 9 5 1 7 4 3 6 2 8 ]
    [ 5 1 9 3 2 6 8 7 4 ]
    [ 2 4 8 9 5 7 1 3 6 ]
    [ 7 6 3 4 1 8 2 5 9 ]

As the above puzzle respect the 3 rules including 9-sub-boxes as shown below:

    [ 4 3 5 ] [ 2 6 9 ] [ 7 8 1 ]
    [ 6 8 2 ] [ 5 7 1 ] [ 4 9 3 ]
    [ 1 9 7 ] [ 8 3 4 ] [ 5 6 2 ]

    [ 8 2 6 ] [ 1 9 5 ] [ 3 4 7 ]
    [ 3 7 4 ] [ 6 8 2 ] [ 9 1 5 ]
    [ 9 5 1 ] [ 7 4 3 ] [ 6 2 8 ]

    [ 5 1 9 ] [ 3 2 6 ] [ 8 7 4 ]
    [ 2 4 8 ] [ 9 5 7 ] [ 1 3 6 ]
    [ 7 6 3 ] [ 4 1 8 ] [ 2 5 9 ]
