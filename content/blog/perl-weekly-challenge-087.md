## TASK #1 › Longest Consecutive Sequence {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an unsorted array of integers `@N`.

Write a script to find the longest consecutive sequence. Print 0 if none sequence found.

## Example 1:

    Input: @N = (100, 4, 50, 3, 2)
    Output: (2, 3, 4)

## Example 2:

    Input: @N = (20, 30, 10, 40, 50)
    Output: 0

## Example 3:

    Input: @N = (20, 19, 9, 11, 10)
    Output: (9, 10, 11)

## TASK #2 › Largest Rectangle {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given matrix `m x n` with `0` and `1`.

Write a script to find the largest rectangle containing only `1`. Print `0` if none found.

## Example 1:

    Input:
        [ 0 0 0 1 0 0 ]
        [ 1 1 1 0 0 0 ]
        [ 0 0 1 0 0 1 ]
        [ 1 1 1 1 1 0 ]
        [ 1 1 1 1 1 0 ]

    Output:
        [ 1 1 1 1 1 ]
        [ 1 1 1 1 1 ]

## Example 2:

    Input:
        [ 1 0 1 0 1 0 ]
        [ 0 1 0 1 0 1 ]
        [ 1 0 1 0 1 0 ]
        [ 0 1 0 1 0 1 ]

    Output: 0

## Example 3:

    Input:
        [ 0 0 0 1 1 1 ]
        [ 1 1 1 1 1 1 ]
        [ 0 0 1 0 0 1 ]
        [ 0 0 1 1 1 1 ]
        [ 0 0 1 1 1 1 ]

    Output:
        [ 1 1 1 1 ]
        [ 1 1 1 1 ]
