## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

With the launch of **The Weekly Challenge - 088**, we have now completed `20 months`. It has been fun and entertaining journey. It gave us the opportunity to meet the best brain across the globe. I never dreamt of knowing so many experts and be among their friends.

Just want to update about my ongoing therapy for my **Depression & Anxiety**, I have had 2 sessions so far, 4 more sessions to go. It has made some positive changes but still far from full recovery. I understand it is going to take long time. One of the issue that I face on a regular basis is that I hate meeting people. I prefer sitting alone and doing nothing. At times, I feel bad not taking part in the weekly challenge. I miss my live video sessions. I miss asking silly **Raku** questions on Twitter. Interacting with so many **Raku** experts always felt nice. They have all been very nice and kind to me. I just hope that I don't forget all that I learnt so far.

## TASK #1 › Array of Product {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of positive integers `@N`.

Write a script to return an array `@M` where `$M[i]` is the product of all elements of `@N` except the index `$N[i]`.

## Example 1:

    Input:
        @N = (5, 2, 1, 4, 3)
    Output:
        @M = (24, 60, 120, 30, 40)

        $M[0] = 2 x 1 x 4 x 3 = 24
        $M[1] = 5 x 1 x 4 x 3 = 60
        $M[2] = 5 x 2 x 4 x 3 = 120
        $M[3] = 5 x 2 x 1 x 3 = 30
        $M[4] = 5 x 2 x 1 x 4 = 40

## Example 2:

    Input:
        @N = (2, 1, 4, 3)
    Output:
        @M = (12, 24, 6, 8)

        $M[0] = 1 x 4 x 3 = 12
        $M[1] = 2 x 4 x 3 = 24
        $M[2] = 2 x 1 x 3 = 6
        $M[3] = 2 x 1 x 4 = 8

## TASK #2 › Spiral Matrix {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given `m x n` matrix of positive integers.

Write a script to print spiral matrix as list.

## Example 1:

    Input:
        [ 1, 2, 3 ]
        [ 4, 5, 6 ]
        [ 7, 8, 9 ]
    Ouput:
        [ 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5 ]

## Example 2:

    Input:
        [  1,  2,  3,  4 ]
        [  5,  6,  7,  8 ]
        [  9, 10, 11, 12 ]
        [ 13, 14, 15, 16 ]
    Output:
        [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 15, 14, 13, 9, 5, 6, 7, 11, 10 ]
