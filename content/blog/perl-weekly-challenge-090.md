## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Today is the first monday of the month and time to declare the champion of last month. With great pleasure, we announce `Simon Green` as the **Champion**. Simon joined the **Team PWC** in the week 68. As of today, he has contributed `41 Perl` solutions with `20 blogs`.

We have two new members joining the team this week. [Clifton Wood](https://github.com/Xliff) and [Joel Crosswhite](https://github.com/jcrosswh).

`Lubos Kolouch` shared fun blog themed on [**Advent Calendar**](https://v.kolouch.org/nextcloud/index.php/apps/cms_pico/pico/lubos/20201206_AoC_d6). I would have made it to our own **Advent Calendar** if it was about one of the tasks associated with the weekly challenge. So what, we can still have fun. Thanks **Lubos** for sharing.

![Contributions Summary](/images/blog/contributions-summary-89.png)

This week, we had `57 contributions` by guests in `36` different languages. This is the best week as far as the guest contributions are concerned. Credit goes to two very reputed members of **Team PWC**, i.e. `Abigail` and `Andrew Shitov`. Honestly I was expecting this from Andrew but Abigail really surprised me. Proud to have super genous brain in our team. You can't ignore other consistent contributors. It would be unfair if I take names here. I would like to `THANK` each and every guest contributors.

## ADVENT CALENDAR {#ADVENTCALENDAR}

Finally we started our own **[Advent Calendar 2020](/blog/advent-calendar-2020)**. I wasn't sure initially because of the daily nature of it. Although I am behind the schedule but I am glad that I took the initiative.

#### [Day 1](/blog/advent-calendar-2020-12-01): Octal Number System / Balanced Brackets by Jaldhar H. Vyas.
#### [Day 2](/blog/advent-calendar-2020-12-02): Make it $200 by Ryan Thompson.
#### [Day 3](/blog/advent-calendar-2020-12-03): LRU Cache by E. Choroba.

#### [Aaron Smith](https://github.com/aaronreidsmith) shared his detail with us:

> I am a Data Engineer based in Austin, TX, USA. I come from a Python background, but my current gig is 100% Scala. My dive into the Perl world happened in grad school and into the beginning of my career when I worked in the Bioinformatics field (largely using BioPerl). More recently, my preferred Perl-family language is Raku, and I have been using it for pet projects for about the last 3 years.

Please find out [**How to contribute?**](/blog/how-to-contribute), if you have any doubts.

Please give it a try to an excellent tool [**EZPWC**](https://github.com/saiftynet/EZPWC) created by respected member `Saif Ahmed` of **Team PWC**.

## TASK #1 › DNA Sequence {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

DNA is a long, chainlike molecule which has two strands twisted into a double helix. The two strands are made up of simpler molecules called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of the four nitrogen-containing nucleobases cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A) and thymine (T).

You are given DNA sequence, `GTAAACCCCTTTTCATTTAGACAGATCGACTCCTTATCCATTCTCAGAGATGTGTTGCTGGTCGCCG`.

Write a script to print nucleiobase count in the given DNA sequence. Also print the complementary sequence where Thymine (T) on one strand is always facing an adenine (A) and vice versa; guanine (G) is always facing a cytosine (C) and vice versa.

To get the complementary sequence use the following mapping:

    T => A
    A => T
    G => C
    C => G
