## TASK #1 › Count Number {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a positive number `$N`.

Write a script to count number and display as you read it.

### Example 1:

    Input: $N = 1122234
    Output: 21321314

    as we read "two 1 three 2 one 3 one 4"

### Example 2:

    Input: $N = 2333445
    Output: 12332415

    as we read "one 2 three 3 two 4 one 5"

### Example 3:

    Input: $N = 12345
    Output: 1112131415

    as we read "one 1 one 2 one 3 one 4 one 5"

<br>

## TASK #2 › Jump Game {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of positive numbers `@N`, where value at each index determines how far you are allowed to jump further.

Write a script to decide if you can jump to the last index. Print 1 if you are able to reach the last index otherwise 0.

### Example 1:

    Input: @N = (1, 3, 1, 2)
    Output: 1

    as we jump one place from index 0 and then three place from index 1 to reach the last index.

### Example 2:

    Input: @N = (2,1,1,0,2)
    Output: 0

    it is impossible to reach the last index. as we jump two place from index 0, followed by one place jump from index 2 to reach the index 3. once you reached the index 3, you can't go any further because you can only jump 0 position further.
