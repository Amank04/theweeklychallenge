## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

We have 2 new members joining the **Team PWC** this week, `Paulo Custodio` and `Mimosinnet`. We now have **211** active members across the globe. It would have been nice to plot the locations in the world map. I have done something similar for my [`Map::Tube`](http://manwar.mooo.info/#map-tube) module. I just have to find the time for the task.

Thank you `Colin Crain` for yet another quality reviews. I have had many positive feedbacks from **Team PWC** members about the same.

`Stuart Little` kept me on my toes with his non-stop **Raku** contributions ever since he joined the team. Proud to have him in the team.

Fortunately, we now have a match for him for **Perl** and he is the newest member **Paulo Custodio**. In the first week itself he contributed solutions to [**Week 89**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-089/paulo-custodio/perl), [**Week 90**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-090/paulo-custodio/perl) and [**Week 91**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-091/paulo-custodio/perl).

## TASK #1 › Isomorphic Strings {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given two strings `$A` and `$B`.

Write a script to check if the given strings are [**Isomorphic**](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-check-if-two-strings-are-isomorphic). Print 1 if they are otherwise 0.

## Example 1:

    Input: $A = "abc"; $B = "xyz"
    Output: 1

## Example 2:

    Input: $A = "abb"; $B = "xyy"
    Output: 1

## Example 3:

    Input: $A = "sum"; $B = "add"
    Output: 0

<br>

***
## TASK #2 › Insert Interval {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a set of sorted non-overlapping intervals and a new interval.

Write a script to merge the new interval to the given set of intervals.

## Example 1:

    Input $S = (1,4), (8,10); $N = (2,6)
    Output: (1,6), (8,10)

## Example 2:

    Input $S = (1,2), (3,7), (8,10); $N = (5,8)
    Output: (1,2), (3,10)

## Example 3:

    Input $S = (1,5), (7,9); $N = (10,11)
    Output: (1,5), (7,9), (10,11)
