## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Congratulation birthday boy `Laurent Rosenfeld` on becoming the first member with `1000+` score. He has maintained the number `#1 position` for the longest period. He is one of the few members associated with us since the beginning. Not many people know that he was our first **Raku** reviewer.

There is another member, `Stuart Little`, who jumped to `#12 position` with 368 score in such a short time.

`Paulo Custodio` also fast rising the leader board with `84` score in just 2 weeks.

I, once reached `#10 position` but have slipped one rank in the recent weeks. Hopefully in the new year 2021, I will try to join the race once again.

## TASK #1 › Max Points {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given set of co-ordinates `@N`.

Write a script to count maximum points on a straight line when given co-ordinates plotted on 2-d plane.

## Example 1:

    |
    |     x
    |   x
    | x
    + _ _ _ _

    Input: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)
    Output: 3

## Example 2:

    |
    |
    | x       x
    |   x
    | x   x
    + _ _ _ _ _

    Input: (1,1), (2,2), (3,1), (1,3), (5,3)
    Output: 3

<br>

***
## TASK #2 › Sum Path {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given binary tree containing numbers `0-9` only.

Write a script to sum all possible paths from root to leaf.

## Example 1:

    Input:
         1
        /
       2
      / \
     3   4

    Output: 13
    as sum two paths (1->2->3) and (1->2->4)

## Example 2:

    Input:
         1
        / \
       2   3
      /   / \
     4   5   6

    Output: 26
    as sum three paths (1->2->4), (1->3->5) and (1->3->6)
