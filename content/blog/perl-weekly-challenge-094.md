## TASK #1 › Group Anagrams {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of strings `@S`.

Write a script to group `Anagrams` together in any random order.

> An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Example 1:
        Input: ("opt", "bat", "saw", "tab", "pot", "top", "was")
        Output: [ ("bat", "tab"),
                  ("saw", "was"),
                  ("top", "pot", "opt") ]


## Example 2:
        Input: ("x")
        Output: [ ("x") ]

<br>

***
## TASK #2 › Binary Tree to Linked List {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a binary tree.

Write a script to represent the given binary tree as an object and flatten it to a linked list object. Finally print the linked list object.

## Example:

        Input:

            1
           / \
          2   3
         / \
        4   5
           / \
          6   7

        Output:

            1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 3
