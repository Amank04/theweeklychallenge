## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Last week, we declared `Niels van Dijke` the last Champion of the year 2020. We are proud to present the **[interview](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/meet-the-champion-2020-12)** with him. As always happens, you get to know a lot about the champion. This time around, I was pleasantly surprised to know a lot about **Niels**.  Not many of you know that **Neils** donated the prize money back to me. I am humbled by his gesture. Thank you, **Neils**. However, I strongly discourage this tradition. This is going to be the first and last time, I accept the offer. I would rather be more happy if future champion accept the small token of gift as `THANK YOU` from all us. You deserve it all.

Running the weekly challenge is my passion. Every time, I receive even a simpe `thank you` message, it gives me energy to keep it going. Honestly speaking, I never dreamt of reaching to fellow hacker across the globe. This has given me the platform to interact with the best brain and learn from them. I believe the knowledge base we have collected **[here](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club)** is priceless. Members like `Stuart Little` and `Paulo Custodio` keep me on my toes all the time by not just dealing with current week task but also grabbing past challenges. I salute their efforts. Keep inspiring us always.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for the generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we can go back and declare weekly champion as we have done in the past. I hope and wish, the year 2021 would make it possible. It doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If big organisation come forward and support us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 â€º Palindrome Number {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a number `$N`.

Write a script to figure out if the given number is `Palindrome`. Print `1` if true otherwise `0`.

## Example 1:

    Input: 1221
    Output: 1

## Example 2:

    Input: -101
    Output: 0, since -101 and 101- are not the same.

## Example 3:

    Input: 90
    Output: 0

<br>

***
## TASK #2 â€º Demo Stack {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

Write a script to demonstrate `Stack` operations like below:

### push($n) - add $n to the stack
### pop() - remove the top element
### top() - get the top element
### min() - return the minimum element

<br>

## Example:

    my $stack = Stack->new;
    $stack->push(2);
    $stack->push(-1);
    $stack->push(0);
    $stack->pop;       # removes 0
    print $stack->top; # prints -1
    $stack->push(0);
    print $stack->min; # prints -1
