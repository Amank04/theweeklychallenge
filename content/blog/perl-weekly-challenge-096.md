## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Before I forget again, I would like to welcome back our friend [**Luca Ferrari**](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/meet-the-champion-2020-04). I still remember his note in his last blog (week #76) before the break.

> On the very next monday, September 7th, I will be in hospital for a new surgery on my (last) working right eye. In particular, I will be doing a trabeculectomy, and I’m pretty sure I will not be able to see anything for a couple of weeks, may be more. I hope my brain is not going to fail in the meantime!

It was great to see him back in action (week #94) after the break.

> Yes, I was away from keyboard for almost four months due to an eye surgery, trabeculectomy, that has done good results on the eye pressure (the main aim), but quite bad results on the eyesight. Therefore, I’m not really happy with that, and I’m trying to figure out how to deal with my new (downgraded) life. As a way to force my brain to stay focused on something different, I decided to start over the Perl Weekly Challenge.

I can relate to him completely as I lost vision in my right eye 17 years ago. Few years ago, the vision of my left eye blurred. As of today, I have enough vision to survive without support. The worst part is that there is no cure and it only happens to one in a million as told by world renowned eye specialist [**Dr. Carlos Pavesio**](https://www.moorfields-private.co.uk/consultants/carlos-pavesio).

Lets get back to fun topic, as we are fast approaching 100th week, do you have any idea/plan to celebrate the moment?  Please do share with us.

Did you notice the rise in popularity of contributions in guest languages?

The best week so far for contributions in guest languages was `week #89` when we had `65 contributions` in `36 languages`. I remember early days we used to get just handful only. I would like to mention one name, [**Laurent Rosenfeld**](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/meet-the-champion-013), associated with us from day one. He is the first champion of the weekly challenge. He is also `rank #1` in the leaders board. Recently he started contributing in Scala as well and currently `rank #14`. While talking about guest language contribuions, how can I forget **Stuart Little**? In just few weeks, he reached `rank #1` in guest leaders board and `rank #12` in regular leaders board. My current `rank #11` is in danger now. Who knows by next week he will be in the top 5.

`Kang-min Liu` introduced new language [**Janet**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-095/gugod/janet/ch-1.janet).

`Cristina Heredia` shared [**Python**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-095/cristian-heredia/python/ch-1.py) solution for the first time.

`Paulo Custodio` shared solutions in **C**, **C++**, **Basic**, **Forth** and **Python** this week. With this, he now jumped to `rank #9` in guest leaders board.

Let us welcome 2 new members joining **Team PWC**, `Mohammad Foda` and `Ali Moradi`.

`Mohammad Foda` introduced 2 new languages, [**Haxe**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-001/mfoda/haxe) and [**Nim**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-001/mfoda/nim) in the very first week.

We now have `214 members` and `7 guests`. By definition, Guest is someone who shared solutions in languages other than **Perl** and **Raku** only. As soon as guest shares at least one solution either in **Perl** or **Raku**, he/she will become full member immediately.

<br>

![Contributions Summary](/images/blog/contributions-summary-95.png)

This week, we received `44 contributions` by guests in `17 languages`.

I would like to `THANK` each and every guest contributors.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for the generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we can go back and declare weekly champion as we have done in the past. I hope and wish, the year 2021 would make it possible. It doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If big organisation come forward and support us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Reverse Words {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a string `$S`.

Write a script to reverse the order of words in the given string. The string may contain leading/trailing spaces. The string may have more than one space between words in the string. Print the result without leading/trailing spaces and there should be only one space between words.

## Example 1:

    Input: $S = "The Weekly Challenge"
    Output: "Challenge Weekly The"

## Example 2:

    Input: $S = "    Perl and   Raku are  part of the same family  "
    Output: "family same the of part are Raku and Perl"

<br>

***
## TASK #2 › Edit Distance {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given two strings `$S1` and `$S2`.

Write a script to find out the minimum operations required to convert `$S1` into `$S2`. The operations can be `insert`, `remove` or `replace` a character. Please check out [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance) for more information.

## Example 1:

    Input: $S1 = "kitten"; $S2 = "sitting"
    Output: 3

    Operation 1: replace 'k' with 's'
    Operation 2: replace 'e' with 'i'
    Operation 3: insert 'g' at the end

## Example 2:

    Input: $S1 = "sunday"; $S2 = "monday"
    Output: 2

    Operation 1: replace 's' with 'm'
    Operation 2: replace 'u' with 'o'
