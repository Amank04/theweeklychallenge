## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `week 97`. Three more weeks to go before we reach the 3-digits figure.

If you remember, recently I request you all to suggest ways to celebrate the big day. You still have time to send in your suggestions. In the meantime, I would like to suggest few bits. I am not sure how many of you are aware of [**White Camel Award**](https://www.perl.org/advocacy/white_camel/). I am thinking of doing something similar along the line.

However, I would not use the word `Camel` in the name as it is not just **Perl** but also **Raku**. Therefore we should come up with a name that represents the both communities. We should also do this every year like **White Camel Award**. Since very soon we would be celeberating our second birthday, why not declare award for `Year 1` and `Year 2` together.

I am also thinking of keeping 3 tracks like **White Camel Award**, one each for **Perl** and **Raku** alongwith **Blogger** category.

Now the most difficult part is how do we decide the winner?

Well again, in my humble opinion, the best person to pick the winners is the who review the code every week. So all the past and current **Perl** reviewers would pick 3 names each in the **Perl** category. Similarly, all past and current **Raku** reviewers would pick 3 names each in **Raku** category. For the **Blogger** category, I would keep it open, all members are **FREE** to suggest their favourite.

Once I have all the names, I would pick one name who get the most votes. In case of tie, I would pick my favourite between the two. Last but not the least, should we give prize as token of thank you? Ideally I would say `Yes`. But we don't have the budget for it now, unfortunately. I am not loosing hopes. There is still time before we announce the winners. I am keeing my fingers crossed.

Please feel free to share your point of views. I am open to any suggestions and critics.

Lets get back to the last week contributions, as always the case in the recent weeks, `Stuart Little` and `Paulo Custodio` took the limelight. While doing so, `Stuart` has taken a big lead in the **Guest Leaders**. The gap between him and second in lead `Roger Bell_West` is huge. Similarly, `Laurent Rosenfeld` is way ahead from the rest of us in the **Leaders Board**.


I remember when `Stuart` joined the team, he shared only **Raku** solutions initially. Last week he surprised me by sharing **Perl** solutions as well. `Tyler Wardhaugh` generally does **Lua** and **Clojure** but he surprised last week by sharing **Python** solutions. Surprise didn't stop there. My friend, `Mohammad Meraj Zia` surprised me with his **Kotlin** solutions for the first time. I love surprises, pleasant one, so keep it coming.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for the generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we can go back and declare weekly champion as we have done in the past. I hope and wish, the year 2021 would make it possible. It doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If big organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Caesar Cipher {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given string `$S` containing alphabets `A..Z` only and a number `$N`.

Write a script to encrypt the given string `$S` using [`Caesar Cipher`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) with left shift of size `$N`.

## Example

    Input: $S = "THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG", $N = 3
    Output: "QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD"

    Plain:    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    Cipher:   XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW

    Plaintext:  THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
    Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD

<br>

## TASK #2 › Binary Substrings {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a binary string `$B` and an integer `$S`.

Write a script to split the binary string `$B` of size `$S` and then find the minimum number of flips required to make it all the same.

## Example 1:

    Input: $B = “101100101”, $S = 3
    Output: 1

    Binary Substrings:
        "101": 0 flip
        "100": 1 flip to make it "101"
        "101": 0 flip

## Example 2:

    Input $B = “10110111”, $S = 4
    Output: 2

    Binary Substrings:
        "1011": 0 flip
        "0111": 2 flips to make it "1011"
