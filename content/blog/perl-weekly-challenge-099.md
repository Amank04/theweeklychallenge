## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***
<br>

Welcome to **Week #99** of the weekly challenge. We are almost there, so please keep your seat belt fastened.

As you all know last week we declared `Stuart Little`, first Champion of 2021. To my surprise he donated the prize money towards the fund for the website. Technical speaking, it never existed before as we never received any donations in the past. I would like to thank `Stuart` for the donation. As of today, the total fund is `Â£40`. I will keep record of all transactions and share with the team at the end of financial year. I am going to use the fund to renew the domain when it expires.

I appeal to all **Team PWC** members to make the **Week #100** special by breaking the record contributions. The current record is held by **Week #001** with 155 contributions of **Perl** and **Raku** solutions as well as blogs. I think it is very much possible with `200+ members`. Even if `100 members` share just either **Perl** or **Raku** only, we can easily go past `200 mark`. Let us create history and be part of it.

In the [**Week #97**](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-097), I shared my idea of celebration. I have had few suggestions so far. I am looking for more, so please keep sharing your views on the same.

In the recent few weeks, I noticed a big jump in the contributions as far as guest languages are concerned. In the early days, we used to receive just 2-4 solutions. But now a days, we get **40+** contributions regularly. I also noticed some members showing love for opposite camp. I mean, **Raku** fan sharing **Perl** solutions and **Perl** fan sharing **Raku**. To me, it is the biggest take away of the initiative started nearly `2 years` ago.

I have seen the popularity of weekly challenge growing every week. Some of the recently joined member surprised me with their commitment and energy. I know from my own experience it is certainly not easy to carry on week after week. I am aware that you have been missing **Raku** reviews for sometimes. I am looking for volunteer to take the responsibilty and show us the power of **Raku**. As far as **Perl** reviews are concerned, `Colin Crain` is doing great. I have seen nice positive comments every time I share the same on **Twitter**, **Facebook** and **Reddit**.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 âº Pattern Match {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a string `$S` and a pattern `$P`.

Write a script to check if given pattern validate the entire string. Print 1 if pass otherwise 0.

The patterns can also have the following characters:

##### ? - Match any single character.
##### * - Match any sequence of characters.

## Example 1:

    Input: $S = "abcde" $P = "a*e"
    Output: 1

## Example 2:

    Input: $S = "abcde" $P = "a*d"
    Output: 0

## Example 3:

    Input: $S = "abcde" $P = "?b*d"
    Output: 0

## Example 4:

    Input: $S = "abcde" $P = "a*c?e"
    Output: 1

<br>

***
## TASK #2 âº Unique Subsequence {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given two strings `$S` and `$T`.

Write a script to find out count of different unique subsequences matching `$T` without changing the position of characters.

### UPDATE: 2021-02-08 09:00AM (UK TIME) suggested by Jonas Berlin, missing entry [5].

## Example 1:

    Input: $S = "littleit', $T = 'lit'
    Output: 5

        1: [lit] tleit
        2: [li] t [t] leit
        3: [li] ttlei [t]
        4: litt [l] e [it]
        5: [l] ittle [it]

## Example 2:

    Input: $S = "london', $T = 'lon'
    Output: 3

        1: [lon] don
        2: [lo] ndo [n]
        3: [l] ond [on]
