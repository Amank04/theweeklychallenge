<br>

The **Week #100** came and gone. Lets continue the journey together and learn something new from each other.

This week `Mark J. Reed` and `Pablo Saavedra` joined the **Team PWC**. We welcome both of them and wish an enjoyable ride with us.

After nearly `5 months` break, I started taking part in the weekly challenge. I hope to continue without break. This week I could only contribute in **Perl** but very soon I will start contributing in **Raku** followed by my favourite guest language `Swift`.

This week, I also create **YouTube** video after a long time. Although I wanted to do live coding but I could only do just one **Thank You** video. I hope you like the video.

<br>

I am happy with the support that we had in the **Week #100** The plan was to beat the previous best figure of `155 contributions` but unfortunately we couldn't get there any where near. To be precise, the final figure for the **Week #100** is `120 contributions`. So I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every member for making it such a memorable week.

<br>

![Contributions Summary](/images/blog/contributions-summary-100.png)

This week, we received `61 contributions` from guests in `21 languages`. We were so close to beat the previous best figure of `65 contributions` in the **Week #089**.

I would like to `THANK` each and every guest contributors.

While we are talking about contributions, let's share some interesting stats from the [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club).

#### 1. Commits: 14,570 (+320)
#### 2. Pull Requests: 3,597 (+77)
#### 3. Contributors: 159 (+1)
#### 4. Fork: 199
#### 5. Stars: 90

<br>

Last but not least, I would like to thank each and every member for their support and encouragement.

<br>

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

#### [Mark J. Reed](https://github.com/markjreed)

> My preferred language is Raku, which I've been using since Pugs was released, but I'm happy to contribute solutions in pretty much anything; if it's a programming language, I've probably used it. So if there are some obscure languages you'd like me to cycle through contributing solutions in, let me know!
> I'm also a big fan of Ruby, which I've been using since before Rails was a thing, and of course Perl, which I've been using since version 4, though I originally put off learning it despite my peers' enthusiastic recommendations because I felt I could already do everything it did using ksh. I think that dates me sufficiently.
> My day job is as a cloud infrastructure architect for the part of WarnerMedia formerly known as Turner, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. Most of what I write there is infrastructure declaration code in Terraform; when I do need to do something imperative it is usually automation using the AWS API, for which I use either Python to talk to the API directly, or bash+AWS CLI (or PowerShell on Windows) for simpler workstation-based tasks. We have some local custom tools written in Python and others written in Go, which has the advantage of letting us distribute precompiled ready-to-run binaries with no module dependencies. There is some Perl and Ruby in our codebase, but no Raku yet.
> Outside of work I code for fun in approximately everything and contribute solutions and the occasional task to RosettaCode and answer questions on StackOverflow.

#### [Pablo Saavedra](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-100/pablo-saavedra)

> I'm from Argentina. I'm studying computer science since 5 five years ago. I really like music, programming, literature, movies. I just started working for a company and their major product is written in Perl. I'm really new to Perl so I thought it would be good practice for me when I get the time. I really like the language so far and I look forward to know much more about it.

Please find out [**How to contribute?**](/blog/how-to-contribute), if you have any doubts.

Please try the n excellent tool [**EZPWC**](https://github.com/saiftynet/EZPWC) created by respected member `Saif Ahmed` of **Team PWC**.

## TASK #1 › Pack a Spiral {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** Stuart Little
***

You are given an array `@A` of items (integers say, but they can be anything).

Your task is to pack that array into an `MxN` matrix spirally counterclockwise, as tightly as possible.

> 'Tightly' means the absolute value |M-N| of the difference has to be as small as possible.

## Example 1:

    Input: @A = (1,2,3,4)

    Output:

        4 3
        1 2

    Since the given array is already a 1x4 matrix on its own, but that's not as tight as possible. Instead, you'd spiral it counterclockwise into

        4 3
        1 2

## Example 2:

    Input: @A = (1..6)

    Output:

        6 5 4
        1 2 3

    or

        5 4
        6 3
        1 2

    Either will do as an answer, because they're equally tight.

## Example 3:

    Input: @A = (1..12)

    Output:

           9  8  7 6
          10 11 12 5
           1  2  3 4

    or

           8  7 6
           9 12 5
          10 11 4
           1  2 3

## TASK #2 › Origin-containing Triangle {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** Stuart Little
***

You are given three points in the plane, as a list of six co-ordinates: `A=(x1,y1)`, `B=(x2,y2)` and `C=(x3,y3)`.

Write a script to find out if the triangle formed by the given three co-ordinates contain origin (0,0).

Print 1 if found otherwise 0.

## Example 1:

    Input: A=(0,1), B=(1,0) and C=(2,2)

    Output: 0 because that triangle does not contain (0,0).

## Example 2:

    Input: A=(1,1), B=(-1,1) and C=(0,-3)

    Output: 1 because that triangle contains (0,0) in its interior.

## Example 3:

    Input: A=(0,1), B=(2,0) and C=(-6,0)

    Output: 1 because (0,0) is on the edge connecting B and C.
