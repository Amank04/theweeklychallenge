## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***
<br>

Welcome to the `Week #102`. It has been relatively quiet week, I noticed. Even I am not well, just the seasonal bit. I hope to come back harder this week.

Today is the first Monday of the month and time to declare the Champion. I am proud to announce `James Smith` as the **Champion of the Month**.

This week, we received `37 contributions` from guests in `15 languages`.

I would like to `THANK` each and every guest contributors.

<br>

While we are talking about contributions, let's share some interesting stats from the [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club).

#### 2. Pull Requests: 3,633 (+36)
#### 3. Contributors: 160 (+1)

<br>

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Rare Numbers {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

You are given a positive integer `$N`.

Write a script to generate all Rare numbers of size `$N` if exists. Please checkout the [page](http://www.shyamsundergupta.com/rare.htm) for more information about it.

## Examples

    (a) 2 digits: 65
    (b) 6 digits: 621770
    (c) 9 digits: 281089082


<br>

## TASK #2 › Hash-counting String {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** Stuart Little
***

You are given a positive integer `$N`.

Write a script to produce Hash-counting string of that length.

The definition of a hash-counting string is as follows:

#### - the string consists only of digits 0-9 and hashes, '#'
#### - there are no two consecutive hashes: '##' does not appear in your string
#### - the last character is a hash
#### - the number immediately preceding each hash (if it exists) is the position of that hash in the string, with the position being counted up from 1

It can be shown that for every positive integer N there is exactly one such length-N string.

## Examples:

    (a) "#" is the counting string of length 1
    (b) "2#" is the counting string of length 2
    (c) "#3#" is the string of length 3
    (d) "#3#5#7#10#" is the string of length 10
    (e) "2#4#6#8#11#14#" is the string of length 14
