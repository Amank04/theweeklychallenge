## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***
<br>

Welcome to the **Week #105**. We are almost there to complete our second year of **The Weekly Challenge (a.k.a. Perl Weekly Challenge)**. It has been a great experience. I have never done anything on this scale before. It became possible only with the support and encouragement of **Team PWC**. I am happy to see **Perl** and **Raku** fans maintain the healthy relationship on this platform. There is so much respect for each other, it is unreal. Again credit goes to the maturity and understanding of **Team PWC**.

Well, the mission was primarily focus on **Perl** and **Raku** but in recent months I noticed substantial growth in the popularity of guest contributions. There are many names who have contributed in guest languages. It would be unfair if I pick one or two. You know very well, who I am talking about. It is hard to believe that we now have over guest contributions in `50+` different languages. There are some languages that I never heard of before, I must confess. This week, we received `62` guest contributions, the second best overall. Of those, `38` have been contributed by one member, `Abigail`.

I am thinking of making another video to celebrate the successfull completion of second year, just like I did to celebrate the `100th` week. Is there anything you would like me talk about? Please drop me your suggestions, before `25th March`. I might take part in the challenge as well, again it depends how busy I am this week. Next week, we are going to announce the winners of year `2020-21`. It is the most difficult thing to do but I do have the support team of **Perl** and **Raku** reviewers.

Enjoy this week challenge and keep sharing the knowledge.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.
