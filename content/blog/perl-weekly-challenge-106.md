## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***
<br>

Belated `2nd Birthday` everyone assoicated with `The Weekly Challenge (a.k.a. Perl Weekly Challenge)`.

Apology for not getting the celebration video done on the day. I have been extra busy with the routine office work and would remain so next couple of weeks. I promise to do a propoer one when I have some spare time.

### Did you notice something this week?
<br>

The popularity of guest contributions is catching up with **Perl** and **Raku**. The best part is that the very same members who are doing **Perl** and/or **Raku** are responsible for it. You know who I am talking about. Please keep up the great work.

Talking about contributions, how can I miss `Colin Crain` great reviews week after week? He has been phenomenal. The energy never dips even for a moment. It is remarkable. I can't thank him enough for his service. I wish I could do more to make his life easier. Although I don't get to interact with him as regular as before but I do appreciate his hard work.

I will try to take part in this special week challenge but no promise. I love to hear nice thing from Colin during code review.

An appeal to all **Raku** fans, can you please help us with the **Raku Reviews**? I feel bad that it has been neglected for weeks now. I hope and wish very soon we would have a volunteer to help with **Raku**. `Fingers Crossed`.

I have not forgotten about the declaration of winners for the second year. I will do it together with the release of celebration video. Promise, a gentleman promise.

<br>

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Maximum Gap {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

You are given an array of integers `@N`.

Write a script to display the maximum difference between two successive elements once the array is sorted.

If the array contains only 1 element then display 0.

## Example

    Input: @N = (2, 9, 3, 5)
    Output: 4

    Input: @N = (1, 3, 8, 2, 0)
    Output: 5

    Input: @N = (5)
    Output: 0

<br>

***
## TASK #2 › Decimal String {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

You are given numerator and denominator i.e. `$N` and `$D`.

Write a script to convert the fraction into decimal string. If the fractional part is recurring then put it in parenthesis.

## Example

    Input: $N = 1, $D = 3
    Output: "0.(3)"

    Input: $N = 1, $D = 2
    Output: "0.5"

    Input: $N = 5, $D = 66
    Output: "0.0(75)"
