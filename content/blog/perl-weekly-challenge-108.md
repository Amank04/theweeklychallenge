## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

For the second week in a row, I have participated in the weekly challenge. Looks like, I am getting there, still a long way to my good old routine. I enjoy the company of `Lance Wicks` and kind of getting motivated as well. This week also **Lance** shared live video session, so am I. Please find below the links for the two.

`Colin Crain` surprised us this week by sharing the blog posts for the past 5 weeks as well as current week. It is a big deal since he is also our in-house `Perl Reviewer`. I would like to share his work with the team so that we can also benefit by his blogs.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.
