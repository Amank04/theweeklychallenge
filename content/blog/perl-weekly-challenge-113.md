## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Represent Integer {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

You are given a positive integer `$N` and a digit `$D`.

Write a script to check if `$N` can be represented as a sum of positive integers having `$D` at least once. If check passes print 1 otherwise 0.

## Example

    Input: $N = 25, $D = 7
    Output: 0 as there are 2 numbers between 1 and 25 having the digit 7 i.e. 7 and 17. If we add up both we don't get 25.

    Input: $N = 24, $D = 7
    Output: 1

<br>

## TASK #2 › Recreate Binary Tree {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

You are given a Binary Tree.

Write a script to replace each node of the tree with the sum of all the remaining nodes.

## Example

### Input Binary Tree

            1
           / \
          2   3
         /   / \
        4   5   6
         \
          7

### Output Binary Tree

            27
           /  \
          26  25
         /   /  \
        24  23  22
         \
         21
