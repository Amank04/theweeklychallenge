## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Let us all welcome, `Christian Jaeger`, to the **Team PWC**. In the first week itself, we have received solutions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-113/christian-jaeger/perl) and [**Haskell**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-113/christian-jaeger/haskell). And not only that we even had bonus, [**blog**](http://functional-perl.org/docs/blog/perl-weekly-challenges-113.xhtml) as well. Thank you, `Christian`, for introducing [**FunctionalPerl**](https://metacpan.org/pod/FunctionalPerl).

We had another surprise from our regular team members, `Flavio Poletti`. He shared [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-113/polettix/raku) solutions for the first time. To me, it is an achievement, that a regular **Perl** contributor becomes **Raku** contributor. Similarly in the past, `Arne Sommer`, who used to contribute only **Raku** solutions then suddenly one week he started contributing **Perl** solutions too.  Thank you **Team PWC** for your contributions.

<br>

Let us share some interesting stats from the [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club).

#### 1. Commits: 16,903 (+157)
#### 2. Pull Requests: 4,126 (+36)
#### 3. Contributors: 166 (+1)
#### 4. Fork: 209 (+2)
#### 5. Stars: 91

<br>

Last but not least, I would like to thank each and every member for their support and encouragement.

<br>

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Next Palindrome Number {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

You are given a positive integer `$N`.

Write a script to find out the next `Palindrome Number` higher than the given integer `$N`.

## Example

    Input: $N = 1234
    Output: 1331

    Input: $N = 999
    Output: 1001

<br>

## TASK #2 › Higher Integer Set Bits {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

You are given a positive integer `$N`.

Write a script to find the next higher integer having the same number of 1 bits in binary representation as `$N`.

## Example

    Input: $N = 3
    Output: 5

    Binary representation of $N is 011. There are two 1 bits. So the next higher integer is 5 having the same the number of 1 bits i.e. 101.

    Input: $N = 12
    Output: 17

    Binary representation of $N is 1100. There are two 1 bits. So the next higher integer is 17 having the same number of 1 bits i.e. 10001.
