## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #115` with the [**interview with Tyler Wardhaugh**]("/blog/meet-the-champion-2021-03").

Last week started with the pleasant surprise from `Dave Cross` who shared [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-114/dave-cross/perl) solutions first thing on Monday morning.

I would also like to mention another name `Christian Jaeger` who joined the **Team PWC** recently introduced [**FunctionalPerl**](https://metacpan.org/pod/FunctionalPerl) and shared his [**solution**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-114/christian-jaeger/perl/ch-1.pl) using it.

Welcome back `Richard Park` and thanks for sharing [**APL**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-114/richard-park/apl) solutions.

It is always pleasure to see `Lance Wicks` back in action. Thanks for sharing [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-114/lance-wicks/perl) solution. However I do miss your live video session.

I am back in action after a gap of 2 weeks. Reason for the break is I am currently busy getting adjusted to the new role I have taken up. I even managed to get the videos published as well. I really enjoy making videos.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › String Chain {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

You are given an array of strings.

Write a script to find out if the given strings can be chained to form a circle. Print 1 if found otherwise 0.

> A string $S can be put before another string $T in circle if the last character of $S is same as first character of $T.

## Examples:

    Input: @S = ("abc", "dea", "cd")
    Output: 1 as we can form circle e.g. "abc", "cd", "dea".

    Input: @S = ("ade", "cbd", "fgh")
    Output: 0 as we can't form circle.

<br>

## TASK #2 › Largest Multiple {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

You are given a list of positive integers (0-9), single digit.

Write a script to find the largest multiple of 2 that can be formed from the list.

## Examples

    Input: @N = (1, 0, 2, 6)
    Output: 6210

    Input: @N = (1, 4, 2, 8)
    Output: 8412

    Input: @N = (4, 1, 7, 6)
    Output: 7614
