## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

I have seen the familiar faces, [**Bob Lied**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-116/bob-lied/perl) and [**Cristina Heredia**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-116/cristian-heredia/perl), back again. **Cristina** even shared [**Python**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-116/cristian-heredia/python). Thanks for your contributions.

I know, I haven't participated in the weekly challenge in the last 2 weeks. Too busy in my new job. I will try to find some time for video session at least this week. Promise.

I would also like to thank **Team PWC** with the suggestion for weekly tasks. I can't thank you enough. It is a big help and saves me from the hassle for looking fun tasks. Please keep sharing new fun tasks.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #2 › Find Possible Paths {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [E. Choroba](https://github.com/choroba)

You are given size of a triangle.

Write a script to find all possible paths from top to the bottom right corner.

In each step, we can either move horizontally to the right (H), or move downwards to the left (L) or right (R).

#### BONUS: Try if it can handle triangle of size 10 or 20.

## Example 1:

    Input: $N = 2

               S
              / \
             / _ \
            /\   /\
           /__\ /__\ E

    Output: RR, LHR, LHLH, LLHH, RLH, LRH

## Example 2:

    Input: $N = 1
