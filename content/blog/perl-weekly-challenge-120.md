## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Week #119 seems to be a memorable week. So many things happened and so fast. Domain name switch over is ongoing.

Is it coincidence the domain switch brought sudden interest and new members as listed below. I welcome each one and wish a great enjoyable journey with us.

It is with great pride, I announce, `Abigail`, the next Champion of The Weekly Challenge. It is an honour to have Abigail in our team. He has been consistent contributor to the weekly challenge. Not only **Perl** but whole bunch of guest languages. As of today, he is `rank #1` as guest contributor and `rank #18` in the regular leader board.

`Lance` is back with live video session. He has been a great influencer. Watch him live in action.

`Paulo Custodio` has been a great supporter of the weekly challenge. It feels nice to have such an enthusiastic member. He has now moved to `rank #2` as guest contributor.

Did anyone notice `James Smith` participation? It reminds me of my youger days. I was like him full of energy and fight with code all the time to make it better.

The weekly challenge has made one positive change, in my humble opinion, introduced so many new guest languages. Last week, `James` introduced [**CESIL**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-119/james-smith/cesil/ch-1.ces). Similary, `Eric`, shared [**Excel VBA**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-119/eric-cheung/excel-vba) solutions. How can `Gabor` stays behind, he shared solutions in [**Crystal**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-119/szabgab/crystal). Now **Gabor**, being Gabor, he shared blog about it too. [**Task #1**](https://code-maven.com/crystal-swap-nibbles) and [**Task #2**](https://code-maven.com/crystal-sequence-without-1-on-1). While talking about guest contributions, I would like to welcome `Richard Park` after the short break. He is our inhouse **APL** master and shared [**solutions**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-119/richard-park/apl) in **APL**. `Lucas Ransan` introduced a new guest language, [**Myrddin**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-119/luc65r/myrddin) as well.

Last but not the least, `Colin Crain`. He is the one who consistently working on weekly reviews every week for so long. If you look at the quality you would agree with me, it is time taken process and definitely not easy one. I can tell you from my own experience. Getting into the skin of others code is the most difficult task when you have a team of super genious brains. I can't thank `Colin` enough for his contributions.

I noticed we have `119` contributions in **Perl** and **Raku** as well as blog in the `Week #119`. So many co-incidence, cool.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Swap Odd/Even bits {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

You are given a positive integer `$N` less than or equal to 255.

Write a script to swap the odd positioned bit with even positioned bit and print the decimal equivalent of the new binary representation.

## Example

    Input: $N = 101
    Output: 154

    Binary representation of the given number is 01 10 01 01.
    The new binary representation after the odd/even swap is 10 01 10 10.
    The decimal equivalent of 10011010 is 154.

    Input: $N = 18
    Output: 33

    Binary representation of the given number is 00 01 00 10.
    The new binary representation after the odd/even swap is 00 10 00 01.
    The decimal equivalent of 100001 is 33.

<br>

## TASK #2 › Clock Angle {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Cheok-Yin Fung](https://github.com/E7-87-83)
***

You are given time `$T` in the format `hh:mm`.

Write a script to find the smaller angle formed by the hands of an analog clock at a given time.

##### HINT: A analog clock is divided up into 12 sectors. One sector represents 30 degree (360/12 = 30).
<br>

## Example

    Input: $T = '03:10'
    Output: 35 degree

    The distance between the 2 and the 3 on the clock is 30 degree.
    For the 10 minutes i.e. 1/6 of an hour that have passed.
    The hour hand has also moved 1/6 of the distance between the 3 and the 4, which adds 5 degree (1/6 of 30).
    The total measure of the angle is 35 degree.

    Input: $T = '04:00'
    Output: 120 degree
