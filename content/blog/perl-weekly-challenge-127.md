## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Congratulation **Team PWC** for reaching the `100+` contributions once again. We had `45` guest contributions too. Not a bad effort considering it is still holiday period for many members.

Did you have notice, the github repository [**Perl Weekly Challenge Club**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club) now have `100` stars and `220` forks. I must inform you that we have been given stars by non participants as well. It shows how popular is our club.

We now have the interview with our recent champion [**Flavio Poletti**](/blog/meet-the-champion-2021-07) LIVE now. Please take a look and find out more about him and his journey so far.

Let us welcome, [**Konstantinos Giannakakis**](https://github.com/konstantinos-giannakakis). an experienced **Perl** hacker to **Team PWC**. I hope and wish him enjoyable journey with us.

Welcome back `Andrew Shitov` and thanks for promoting **The Weekly Challenge** contributions in the recently concluded **Raku Conference**. Also thanks for contribution to [**Task #1**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-126/ash/raku/ch-1.raku) in **Raku**.

Welcome back `Andinus` after a short break. Thanks for your solutions in **Raku** to [**Task #1**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-126/andinus/raku/ch-1.raku) and [**Task #2**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-126/andinus/raku/ch-2.raku).  Not only that, you even shared [**blog**](https://andinus.tilde.institute/pwc/challenge-126) with us. Thank you.

Welcome back `Richard Park` after a short break. It is always pleasure to see you in action. In over `75+` guest languages, **Python** still leading with nearly `500` solutions. However, for me, **APL** is very special as it is unique language where mostly symbols are used as showed by him in solutions to [**Task #1**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-126/richard-park/apl/ch-1.aplf) and [**Task #2**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-126/richard-park/apl/ch-2.aplf).

Have you seen `Richard`'s live video coding in **APL**?

It is magical. Let me dig out one for you, just in case you want to see.

Welcome back, `Belmark Caday` after the break and thanks for sharing your [**contributions**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-126/belmark-caday/perl).

We had another re-entry of champion, `Tyler Wardhaugh` with his contributions in **Clojure** as in [**Task #1**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-126/tyler-wardhaugh/clojure/src/tw/weekly/c126/t1.clj) and [**Task #2**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-126/tyler-wardhaugh/clojure/src/tw/weekly/c126/t2.clj).

Last but not the least, `Duane Powell` made a comeback after a short break with his [**contributions**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-126/duane-powell/perl).

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Disjoint Sets {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

You are given two sets with unique integers.

Write a script to figure out if they are disjoint.

> The two sets are disjoint if they don't have any common members.

## Example

    Input: @S1 = (1, 2, 5, 3, 4)
           @S2 = (4, 6, 7, 8, 9)
    Output: 0 as the given two sets have common member 4.

    Input: @S1 = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
           @S2 = (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
    Output: 1 as the given two sets do not have common member.

<br>

## TASK #2 › Conflict Intervals {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a list of intervals.

Write a script to find out if the current interval conflicts with any of the previous intervals.

## Example

    Input: @Intervals = [ (1,4), (3,5), (6,8), (12, 13), (3,20) ]
    Output: [ (3,5), (3,20) ]

        - The 1st interval (1,4) do not have any previous intervals to compare with, so skip it.
        - The 2nd interval (3,5) does conflict with previous interval (1,4).
        - The 3rd interval (6,8) do not conflicts with any of the previous intervals (1,4) and (3,5), so skip it.
        - The 4th interval (12,13) again do not conflicts with any of the previous intervals (1,4), (3,5) and (6,8), so skip it.
        - The 5th interval (3,20) conflicts with the first interval (1,4).

    Input: @Intervals = [ (3,4), (5,7), (6,9), (10, 12), (13,15) ]
    Output: [ (6,9) ]

        - The 1st interval (3,4) do not have any previous intervals to compare with, so skip it.
        - The 2nd interval (5,7) do not conflicts with the previous interval (3,4), so skip it.
        - The 3rd interval (6,9) does conflict with one of the previous intervals (5,7).
        - The 4th interval (10,12) do not conflicts with any of the previous intervals (3,4), (5,7) and (6,9), so skip it.
        - The 5th interval (13,15) do not conflicts with any of the previous intervals (3,4), (5,7), (6,9) and (10,12), so skip it.
