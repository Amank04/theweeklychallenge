## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Let's welcome `Week #131` with 3 new members i.e. [**Rich Snyder**](https://github.com/cybersnyder), [**Ivan Dimitrov**](https://github.com/ziruzavar) and [**Conor Hoekstra**](https://github.com/codereport).

We now have `240 members` and `10 guests`.

`Conor Hoeksta` introduced new language [**J**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-130/conor-hoekstra/j/ch-1.ijs) to **Team PWC**.

After relatively quiet `Week #129`, last week was much better.

Thanks for `38 Perl`, `19 Raku` and `13 blogs` contributions. Above all we had `26 guest contributions` in `17 languages`.

`Week #130` was special for me as I made a comeback after a gap of `7 weeks` with solution to **Odd Number** task in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-130/mohammad-anwar/perl/ch-1.pl).

If you have any suggestions to make the weekly challenge more interesting and fun then please do share with us.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

    Output: ([1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 8, 9])

## Example 2:
    Input:  (11, 12, 14, 17, 18, 19)
    Output: ([11, 12], [14], [17, 18, 19])

## Example 3:
    Input:  (2, 4, 6, 8)
    Output: ([2], [4], [6], [8])

## Example 4:

<br>

## TASK #2 › Find Pairs {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** `Yary`
***

You are given a string of delimiter pairs and a string to search.

Write a script to return two strings, the first with any characters matching the "opening character" set, the second with any matching the "closing character" set.

## Example 1:
    Input:
        Delimiter pairs: ""[]()
        Search String: "I like (parens) and the Apple ][+" they said.

    Output:
        "(["
        ")]"

## Example 2:
    Input:
        Delimiter pairs: **//<>
        Search String: /* This is a comment (in some languages) */ <could be a tag>

    Output:
        /**/<
        /**/>
