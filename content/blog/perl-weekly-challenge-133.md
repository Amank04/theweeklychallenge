## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #133` and today is the first `Monday` of the month. So it is time to declare the champion.  I announce the next champion, `Jan Krnavek`, a **Raku** enthusiast. He is ranked `#36` in the leaderboard with total score of `218` as of today. He shared `109` solutions in **Raku**.  Congratulation `Jan Krnavek` and thanks for your consistent contributions.

Talking about champion, we now have the [**interview**](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/meet-the-champion-2021-08) with the last champion, `Jorg Sommrey`. Please do check it out.

**Team PWC**, are you taking part in `Hacktoberfest 2021`?

I am sure, most of you are. If you are regular contributor to the weekly challenge then it is lot easier just [**register**](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) your details with them. Luckily I have marked GitHub repository for [**Club Members**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club) and [**Website**](https://github.com/manwar/theweeklychallenge) ready for `Hacktoberfest 2021`.

Last week a collegue, `James Raspass`, from my new office, [**Oleeo**](https://www.oleeo.com/) joined the team. Welcome on board and wish you a enjoyable journey with us.

Welcome back, `Rage311` after a short break. It is always pleasure to see members coming back and share the knowledge with the team.

I am expecting few more this month.

As far as my contributions are concerned, I have shared solutions to both [**Task #1**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-132/mohammad-anwar/perl/ch-1.pl) and [**Task #2**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-132/mohammad-anwar/perl/ch-2.pl) in **Perl** after a long time. If you noticed, I submitted my solutions at around 2am well past the deadline last night.

Last but not least, keep sharing your knowledge and happy hacking.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Integer Square Root {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a positive integer `$N`.

Write a script to calculate the integer square root of the given number.

Please avoid using built-in function. Find out more about it [**here**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_square_root).

## Examples

    Input: $N = 10
    Output: 3

    Input: $N = 27
    Output: 5

    Input: $N = 85
    Output: 9

    Input: $N = 101
    Output: 10

<br>

## TASK #2 › Smith Numbers {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

Write a script to generate first 10 `Smith Numbers` in base 10.

According to [**Wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_number):

> In number theory, a Smith number is a composite number for which, in a given number base, the sum of its digits is equal to the sum of the digits in its prime factorization in the given number base.
