## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #134`, we had more engagements than the previous week. Looks like `Hacktoberfest` festival is keeping everyone busy. We have participated in the annual event every year without fail. I am hoping it would get even busier.

We have a new guest, `E. Alvarez`, joined the team last week. Welcome to the **Team PWC**.

A new guest language, [**Nuweb**](http://www.literateprogramming.com/nuweb.pdf), introduced by `Adam Russell` as well as sharing solution to [**Task #1**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-133/adam-russell/nuweb/ch-1.w) in the same.

Welcome back, `Jaldhar H. Vyas`, after a short back. Thanks for your complete [**solutions**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-133/jaldhar-h-vyas).

A polite request to the last champion, `Jan Krnavek`, please get in touch with us so that we can send you the prize money in your local currency. Unfortunately we don't have your email to contact you. I left message for you in the **GitHub PR** you submitted earlier. Thank you for your support and encouragements,

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Pandigital Numbers {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

Write a script to generate first 5 `Pandigital Numbers` in base 10.

As per the [**wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandigital_number), it says:

> A pandigital number is an integer that in a given base has among its significant digits each digit used in the base at least once.

<br>

## TASK #2 › Distinct Terms Count {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

You are given 2 positive numbers, `$m` and `$n`.

Write a script to generate multiplcation table and display count of distinct terms.

## Example 1

    Input: $m = 3, $n = 3
    Output:

          x | 1 2 3
          --+------
          1 | 1 2 3
          2 | 2 4 6
          3 | 3 6 9

    Distinct Terms: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
    Count: 6

## Example 2

    Input: $m = 3, $n = 5
    Output:

          x | 1  2  3  4  5
          --+--------------
          1 | 1  2  3  4  5
          2 | 2  4  6  8 10
          3 | 3  6  9 12 15

    Distinct Terms: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15
    Count: 11
