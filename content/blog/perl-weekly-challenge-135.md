## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #135`.  We are nearly halfway through the `Hacktoberfest` already. If you haven't kickstarted your journey then please don't delay it any further. You still have time submit minimum `4 Pull Requests` to receive the specially designed T-shirt anywhere in the world, thanks to the origaniser, `Digital Ocean`.

`Roger Bell_West` reminded me last week that we have now received `5000+ Pull Requests`. It is a big deal considering not every members of **Team PWC** submits code using PR.

We have had another busy week as far as guest contributions are concerned. `Abigail` is mainly responsible for it. I would like to say **A big Thank You** to `Abigail` for his consistent contributions. Last week we received `61` solutions. We crossed `50+` mark after a gap of **10 weeks**.

With regard to the regular contributions, we are not far behind either. Last week, we received `90` contributions altogether as compared to `93` the week before. Kudos to each and every contributors.

I have proposed a new logo for the weekly challenge, did you notice at the top of the page? Please do let know what do you think?

I request everyone to keep the momentum going. Also please do share your suggestions to make it even more fun to participate.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.
