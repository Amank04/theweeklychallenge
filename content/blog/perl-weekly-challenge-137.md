<br>

### Let us welcome November with a bang !!!

<br>

Today is the first `Monday` of the month and it is the time to declare the champion of the weekly challenge.

<br>

### Paulo Custodio

<br>

With great pleasure, I announce, `Paulo Custodio` as the champion. As of today, he is ranked `#24` with score `354` in the leader board. He is also ranked `#3` with score `402` in the guest leader board. He is a regular contributor in **Perl** as well as **Ada**, **Adb**, **Awk**, **Basic**, **Bc**, **Brainfuck**, **C**, **C++**, **D**, **Forth**, **Fortran**, **Lua**, **Pascal** and **Python**.

<br>

### Time to welcome new members
<br>

1) `Karishma Rajput` joined the team as guest with contributions in [**C**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-122/karishma/c/ch-1.c), [**C++**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-122/karishma/cpp/ch1.cpp) and [**JavaScript**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-122/karishma/js/ch-1.js).


2) `Robert DiCicco`, from Little Rock, AR, joined the **Team PWC** as a **Perl Hacker**. He shared his solution in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-136/robert-dicicco/perl/ch-1.pl).

<br>

### Am I being superactive in the last 2 weeks?

<br>

In terms of guest contributions, I would say, yes. I have been contributing **Perl** solutions to **Task #1** or **Task #2** or both sometimes. I have even dared to start contributing in **Raku** well. But the most excitement bit is that I am back on guest contributions category too. In the last 2 weeks, I have translated **Perl** solutions to **Java**, **Python** and **Swift**. This has brought me back in the **Top 20** guest contributors.

<br>

### But then came a moment ...

<br>

I had my booster jab last Wednesday. The jab took me down the very next day. I was on the bed with high temperature. I had to take off sick from work. Friday was better but not fully functional. I kept myself invovled only in office related tasks. Saturday was the worst day, temperature going up and down. I was thinking, was it good idea to take the booster jab? In fact, the first two jabs didn't do anything terrible. So I was hoing this would also go without much trouble. Here I was wrong. Life is so unpredictable. I was still unwell on Sunday. But I was looking forward to the **T20 World Cup** match between **India** and **New Zealand** in the second half of Sunday. It was kind of quater final match and India lost it very badly. Can you imagine? The loss didn't lift my mood as I was already feeling down.

<br>

### Then I decided ...

<br>

Enough is enough, I have to push myself and start processing all the pending **Pull Requests** from the **Team PWC**. I started at **8pm** and finished at midnight. It was time to prepare the [**Perl Weekly Newsletter**](https://perlweekly.com/archive/536.html). As some of you know, I am also co-editor of the weekly newsletter, `Gabor Szabo`, being the chief editor. I submitted the draft at about **5am**. Then I started preparing for the new weekly challenge. This is the whole Sunday night story for me.

<br>

### New ideas?

<br>

Just a gentle reminder, the two champions, **Adam Russell** and **Cheok-Yin Fung**, started a discussion on new ideas for the weekly challenge. Please join them and share your views also. You can find the details [**here**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/issues/5055).

<br>

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Long Year {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

Write a script to find all the years between `1900` and `2100` which is a `Long Year`.

> A year is Long if it has 53 weeks.

<br>

##### **[UPDATED][2021-11-01 16:20:00]:** For more information about `Long Year`, please refer to [**wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date#Weeks_per_year).

<br>

#### Expected Output

    1903, 1908, 1914, 1920, 1925,
    1931, 1936, 1942, 1948, 1953,
    1959, 1964, 1970, 1976, 1981,

## TASK #2 › Lychrel Number {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

You are given a number, 10 <= `$n` <= 1000.

Write a script to find out if the given number is Lychrel number. To keep the task simple, we impose the following rules:

    a. Stop if the number of iterations reached 500.
    b. Stop if you end up with number >= 10_000_000.

<br>

##### **[UPDATED][2021-11-01 16:20:00]:** If you stop because of any of the above two rules then we expect `1` as an output.

<br>

According to [**wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychrel_number):

> A Lychrel number is a natural number that cannot form a palindrome through the iterative process of repeatedly reversing its digits and adding the resulting numbers.

#### Example 1

    Input: $n = 56
    Output: 0

    After 1 iteration, we found palindrome number.
    56 + 65 = 121

#### Example 2

    Input: $n = 57
    Output: 0

    After 2 iterations, we found palindrome number.
     57 +  75 = 132
    132 + 231 = 363

#### Example 3

    Input: $n = 59
    Output: 0

    After 3 iterations, we found palindrome number.
     59 +  95 =  154
    154 + 451 =  605
    605 + 506 = 1111
