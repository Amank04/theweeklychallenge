<br>

Last week, I spoke about celebrating `1000 days` of **The Weekly Challenge** by giving away **FREE T-shirt** to all the champions of the weekly challenge.

I am overwhelmed by the support to the campaign. I have created [**blog post**](/1000-days) with all the details. Please check it out and share your suggestions as well.

We received the first contribution in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-139/jake/perl/ch-1.pl )by newly joined member, `Jake`.

`Simon Green` shared solutions in [**Python**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-139/sgreen/python) for the first time.

I have also participated this week and shared solutions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-139/mohammad-anwar/perl/ch-1.pl), [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-139/mohammad-anwar/raku/ch-1.raku), [**Java**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-139/mohammad-anwar/java/theweeklychallenge/JortSort.java), [**Python**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-139/mohammad-anwar/python/ch-1.py) and [**Swift**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-139/mohammad-anwar/swift/ch-1.swift).

I am not sure if you noticed it. We have been receiving guest contributions regularly. For the last **7 weeks**, we have received `50+` contributions every week.

#### Week 133: 53
#### Week 134: 63
#### Week 135: 51
#### Week 136: 53
#### Week 137: 62
#### Week 138: 59
#### Week 139: 57

Similarly regular contributions is also going great. Last **7 weeks** records shows we have received `90+` contributions every week.

#### Week 133: 93
#### Week 134: 92
#### Week 135: 102
#### Week 136: 93
#### Week 137: 96
#### Week 138: 97
#### Week 139: 95

Last but not least, I would like to thank each and every member for their support and encouragement.

<br>

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Add Binary {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given two decimal-coded binary numbers, `$a` and `$b`.

Write a script to simulate the addition of the given binary numbers.

> The script should simulate something like $a + $b. (operator overloading)

### Example 1

    Input: $a = 11; $b = 1;
    Output: 100

### Example 2

    Input: $a = 101; $b = 1;
    Output: 110

### Example 3

    Input: $a = 100; $b = 11;
    Output: 111

<br>

## TASK #2 › Multiplication Table {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

You are given 3 positive integers, `$i`, `$j` and `$k`.

Write a script to print the `$k`th element in the sorted multiplication table of `$i` and `$j`.

### Example 1

    Input: $i = 2; $j = 3; $k = 4
    Output: 3

    Since the multiplication of 2 x 3 is as below:

        1 2 3
        2 4 6

    The sorted multiplication table:

        1 2 2 3 4 6

    Now the 4th element in the table is "3".

### Example 2

    Input: $i = 3; $j = 3; $k = 6
    Output: 4

    Since the multiplication of 3 x 3 is as below:

        1 2 3
        2 4 6
        3 6 9

    The sorted multiplication table:

        1 2 2 3 3 4 6 6 9

    Now the 6th element in the table is "4".
