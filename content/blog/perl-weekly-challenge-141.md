<br>

We are getting closer to the `1000 days` of **The Weekly Challenge**. I would like to thank each and every sponsor of the `FREE T-shirt` campaign. Please do check out the [**blog post**](/blog/1000-days) for up to date information about the campaign.

We have a new member in the **Team PWC**, `David Santiago`. He is a **Raku** fan.

Welcome back `Mano Chandar` after a long break. You last participated in the **Week 73** as per our records.

Welcome back `Alexander Pankoff`. Last time you participated in the weekly challenge was in the **Week 100**.

The next few days would be devoted to the preparation of `Advent Calendar` of **The Weekly Challenge**. It would be our `3rd` in a row. Thanks to all the contributors. If you want any of your blog post to be part of `Advent Calendar` then please do let me know.

Enjoy the cold weather but stay safe.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Number Divisors {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

Write a script to find `lowest 10 positive integers` having exactly `8 divisors`.

## Example

    24 is the first such number having exactly 8 divisors.
    1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24.

<br>

## TASK #2 › Like Numbers {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***
i
You are given positive integers, `$m` and `$n`.

Write a script to find total count of integers created using the digits of `$m` which is also divisible by `$n`.

Repeating of digits are not allowed. Order/Sequence of digits can't be altered. You are only allowed to use (n-1) digits at the most. For example, 432 is not acceptable integer created using the digits of 1234. Also for 1234, you can only have integers having no more than three digits.

## Example 1:

    Input: $m = 1234, $n = 2
    Output: 9

    Possible integers created using the digits of 1234 are:
    1, 2, 3, 4, 12, 13, 14, 23, 24, 34, 123, 124, 134 and 234.

    There are 9 integers divisible by 2 such as:
    2, 4, 12, 14, 24, 34, 124, 134 and 234.

## Example 2:

    Input: $m = 768, $n = 4
    Output: 3

    Possible integers created using the digits of 768 are:
    7, 6, 8, 76, 78 and 68.

    There are 3 integers divisible by 4 such as:
    8, 76 and 68.
