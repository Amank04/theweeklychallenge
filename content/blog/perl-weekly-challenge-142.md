Today is the first Monday of the month. You guessed it right, time to declare the Champion of The Weekly Challenge. With great pride, I declare `W. Luis Mochan` as our next Champion. `Luis` joined the **Team PWC** in the `Week 88`. Till date, he has contributed `102 Perl` solutions and `51 blogs`. He only missed `3 weeks` ever i.e. **103, 104 and 105**. He is currently ranked `30th` with score `306` in the leaderboard. He also became the `52nd` member qualified for the `1000 days celebration`.

Talking about the celebration, so far, we have received `£582.81` in donations. As of today, `29 of 52` members have responded to my email. I am hoping in the next few days, remaining would get back with the details (`T-shirt size and delivery address`). I would like to thank each and every sponsors. Thanks to all members who shared the details with me. I can assure you that your data is in safe hands.

I am keeping the [**blog post**](/blog/1000-days) for up to date. Please do check out if you are interested.

As soon as I get ithe details of the remaining qualified members, I would start designing the `T-shirt` and prepare the order so that it can be dispatch on time.

As you all know, we are running `Advent Calendar` for the `3rd time in a row`. I would like to thank all the contributors to the [**Advent Calendar 2021**](/blog/advent-calendar-2021).

Thank you, `Peter Campbell Smith`, for your [**first blog**](https://pjcs-pwc.blogspot.com/2021/12/perl-weekly-challenge-141-task-1-reads.html) of The Weekly Challenge.

Recently joined member, `Kaushik Tunuguntla`, shared his first solutions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-141/kaushik-tunuguntla/perl). Not only that he also shared the [**blog post**](https://notmondayagain.blogspot.com/2021/12/divisibility-sieves-and-masks-pwc-141.html). Thank you, `Kaushik`.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Divisor Last Digit {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given positive integers, `$m` and `$n`.

Write a script to find total count of divisors of `$m` having last digit `$n`.

<br>

### Example 1:

    Input: $m = 24, $n = 2
    Output: 2

    The divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12.
    There are only 2 divisors having last digit 2 are 2 and 12.

<br>

### Example 2:

    Input: $m = 30, $n = 5
    Output: 2

    The divisors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10 and 15.
    There are only 2 divisors having last digit 5 are 5 and 15.

<br>

## TASK #2 › Sleep Sort {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Adam Russell](https://github.com/adamcrussell)
***

Another joke sort similar to JortSort suggested by champion `Adam Russell`.

You are given a list of numbers.

Write a script to implement `Sleep Sort`. For more information, please checkout this [**post**](https://iq.opengenus.org/sleep-sort).
