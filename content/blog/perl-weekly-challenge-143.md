<br>

First thing first, let us [**Meet The Champion - W. Luis Mochan**](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/meet-the-champion-2021-11).

I am sure, you all wanted to know about the `1000 days T-shirt campaign`. I have had few more responses from the champions. There are still quite a lot members who have not replied to my email. I am waiting for the response before I move to next stage. I would recommend to check out the [**blog post**](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/1000-days) for more update. Thanks to all the sponsors.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Calculator {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a string, `$s`, containing mathematical expression.

Write a script to print the result of the mathematical expression. To keep it simple, please only accept `+ - * ()`.

### Example 1:

        Input: $s = "10 + 20 - 5"
        Output: 25

### Example 2:

        Input: $s = "(10 + 20 - 5) * 2"
        Output: 50

<br>

## TASK #2 › Stealthy Number {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a positive number, `$n`.

Write a script to find out if the given number is `Stealthy Number`.

> A positive integer N is stealthy, if there exist positive integers a, b, c, d such that a * b = c * d = N and a + b = c + d + 1.

## Example 1

    Input: $n = 36
    Output: 1

    Since 36 = 4 (a) * 9 (b) = 6 (c) * 6 (d) and 4 (a) + 9 (b) = 6 (c) + 6 (d) + 1.

## Example 2

    Input: $n = 12
    Output: 1

    Since 2 * 6 = 3 * 4 and 2 + 6 = 3 + 4 + 1

## Example 3

    Input: $n = 6
    Output: 0

    Since 2 * 3 = 1 * 6 but 2 + 3 != 1 + 6 + 1
