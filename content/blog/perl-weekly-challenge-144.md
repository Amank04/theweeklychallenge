Apology for the delay in the release of the weekly challenge.

I would like to start the week with a good news, the fund for the `1000 days T-shirt campaign` is now `£1029.74`, thanks to all sponsors, specially last minute surprise sponsor, `Pete Sergeant`.

I am just waiting to get the response from the remaining champions before I move to next stage of the campaign. As of today, I have received `32 confirmations` out of `53`. I know it is festive season, everyone is busy with family. I would appreciate if you could please take a few moments and reply to my email asap. For more updates, please check out the [**blog post**](blog/1000-days).

Welcome back, `Mark Senn`, after a long break and thanks for the [**contributions**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-143/mark-senn). Also thanks for introducing a new language, `Wolfram`.

We had bonus review this week by our in-house **Perl** reviewer, `Colin Crain`.  Thank you for the quality reviews every week.

Talking about bonus, I am back with the **YouTube Videos** after nearly `5 months`. I had days off the work, so I did it **5 videos back to back**. I hope you like the video. If you do please share with your friends. `Thank You`.

If you want to checkout my previous videos then please do visit my [**YouTube Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/c/mohammadsajidanwar). As of today, I have got `145 subscribers`, not a big number but big enough to keep me motivated. Thank you once again all the subscribers.

<br>

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Semiprime {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

Write a script to generate all `Semiprime` number `<= 100`.

For more information about `Semiprime`, please checkout the [**wikipedia page**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiprime).

<br>

> In mathematics, a semiprime is a natural number that is the product of exactly two prime numbers. The two primes in the product may equal each other, so the semiprimes include the squares of prime numbers.

<br>

## Example

    10 is Semiprime as 10 = 2 x 5
    15 is Semiprime as 15 = 3 x 5

<br>

## TASK #2 › Ulam Sequence {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given two positive numbers, `$u` and `$v`.

Write a script to generate `Ulam Sequence` having at least 10 `Ulam numbers` where `$u` and `$v` are the first 2 `Ulam numbers`.

For more information about `Ulam Sequence`, please checkout the [**website**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_number).

> The standard Ulam sequence (the (1, 2)-Ulam sequence) starts with U1 = 1 and U2 = 2. Then for n > 2, Un is defined to be the smallest integer that is the sum of two distinct earlier terms in exactly one way and larger than all earlier terms.

## Example 1

    Input: $u = 1, $v = 2
    Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 16, 18

## Example 2

    Input: $u = 2, $v = 3
    Output: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 18, 19

## Example 3

    Input: $u = 2, $v = 5
    Output: 2, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 19, 23
