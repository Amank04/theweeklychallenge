## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

<br>

`Merry Christmas` to all the members of **Team PWC**. I wish you all the happiness in the world.

Last week for me was for the family. I spent quality time with kids. I have another week off left. I am looking forward to it. I hope and wish you also had great time with your loved ones. I would like to thank the dedicated and passionate members of **Team PWC** who still manage to contribute in the holiday season. I know it is not easy but you still did it. I suggest if you struggle for time for the weekly challenge then simply attempt only task one as it generally takes no time. I would like mention one name specially, `Colin Crain`, for being the one-man army when it comes to **Perl Reviews**. You have done a brilliant job. It is no longer a secret how much your work is appreciated by the **Team PWC** members.

With the regard to the `1000 days T-shirt campaign`, I haven't had any response from the remaining champions. I can understand they are busy with the family. I am hoping in the new year they will find time to respond to my email.

This is the last week of the year `2021`, let me take this opportunity to say `Good Bye` on behalf of **Team PWC**.

<br>

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Dot Product {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given 2 arrays of same size, `@a` and `@b`.

Write a script to implement `Dot Product`.

## Example:

    @a = (1, 2, 3);
    @b = (4, 5, 6);

    $dot_product = (1 * 4) + (2 * 5) + (3 * 6) => 4 + 10 + 18 => 32

<br>

## TASK #2 › Palindromic Tree {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a string `$s`.

Write a script to create a `Palindromic Tree` for the given string.

I found this [**blog**](https://medium.com/@alessiopiergiacomi/eertree-or-palindromic-tree-82453e75025b) exaplaining `Palindromic Tree` in detail.

## Example 1:

    Input: $s = 'redivider'
    Output: r redivider e edivide d divid i ivi v

## Example 2:

    Input: $s = 'deific'
    Output: d e i ifi f c

## Example 3:

    Input: $s = 'rotors'
    Output: r rotor o oto t s

## Example 4:

    Input: $s = 'challenge'
    Output: c h a l ll e n g

## Example 5:

    Input: $s = 'champion'
    Output: c h a m p i o n

## Example 6:

    Input: $s = 'christmas'
    Output: c h r i s t m a
