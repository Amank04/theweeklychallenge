### Happy New Year

Let us welcome new year `2022` with the happy note as we declare the next champion. As per the tradition, we announce the champion on the first Monday of the month. So the next champion of **The Weekly Challenge** is `Peter Campbell Smith`. As of today, he has contributed `31 Perl` solutions and `5 blogs`. Technically, he is eligible to get the `FREE T-shirt` too. Congratulations `Peter`. Below is the complete breakdown of the contributions by `Peter`.

Start of the year, we have two new members joining the **Team PWC**. First is `Moray Jones` and the second is `Mohammad Khalid Anwar`. Did you notice the similarity between my name and `Khalid`? Well he is my younger brother from `Pune, India`. It took me so long to convince him to join the weekly challenge. I am glad he finally did join us. `Moray` shared solution in [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-145/morayj) whereas `Khalid` shared solutions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-145/khalid-anwar/perl/ch-1.pl) and [**C++**](://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-145/khalid-anwar/cpp/ch-2.cpp) in the first week.

Another interesting event happened last week. For the first time in the history of **The Weekly Challenge**, we received same guest contributions (`89`) as the **Perl** and **Raku** combined contributions (`89`). It is also the best week for guest contributions beating the previous best figure of `86 contributions` in the `Week #109`. The biggest contributors are `Abigail`, `Laurent Rosenfeld` and `Roger Bell_West`.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.
