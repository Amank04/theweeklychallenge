Welcome to the `Week #148` with a new member [**Marton Polgar**](https://github.com/2colours). `Marton` shared solutions in [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-147/2colours/raku) in the very first week.

I get excited everytime, I come across blog post by fellow team members. Last week, `Roger Bell_West` shared very inspiring [**blog post**](https://blog.firedrake.org/archive/2022/01/Polyglot_Programming.html). `Abigail` is the leader in the guest contributions category. I am thankful to all contributors for sharing the knowledge with us.

Inspired by fellow team members, I also started contributing in guest languages.  As of today, my ranking is `#16` with `45 guest contributions` which is nothing as compare to `Abigail` humungous figure of `1176`. At one point, I remember, I slipped to rank `#20`. The best of my guest contribution is that I finally found the courage to share solutions in `Python`. I must  admit, I haven't fallen in love with `Python` yet. Having said, I am going to continue as long as I have spare time.

The coming `Sunday 23rd Jan 2022`, I have set the deadline for the confirmation from the champions. On Monday, I will prepare the final list of champions for the `FREE T-shirt`. I have included `Peter Campbell Smith` to the list as he is the recent champion of the weekly challenge. I request all the champions who haven't shared the postal address and T-shirt size, please do so as soon as possible. For updates, you can check out the [**blog post**](/blog/1000-days).

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.
