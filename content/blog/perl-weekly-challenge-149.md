Welcome to the `Week #149` with a good news that `Pete Sergeant` has promised to sponsor the monthly prize for another `12 months`. I would like to take this opportunity to thank, `Pete`, for the support and encouragement.

As shared last week, `23rd Jan 2022` was the last day for submitting the details by the eligible champions. So, the final list has total of `32 eligible members`. I will now start the work on the design. I will share the design as soon as I am done. Or if you have any suggestions then please do share with me.

Last week was very busy for me and I missed the deadline to submit the solutions. I will try to find time this week to get back on track, wish me luck.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Fibonacci Digit Sum {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Roger Bell_West](https://blog.firedrake.org/)
***

Given an input `$N`, generate the first `$N` numbers for which the sum of their digits is a Fibonacci number.

## Example

    f(20)=[0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, 20, 21, 23, 26, 30, 32, 35, 41, 44]

<br>

## TASK #2 › Cardano Triplets {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Roger Bell_West](https://blog.firedrake.org/)
***

Given a number base, derive the largest perfect square with no repeated digits and return it as a string. (For base>10, use 'A'..'Z'.)

## Example:

        f(2)="1"
        f(4)="3201"
        f(10)="9814072356"
        f(12)="B8750A649321"
