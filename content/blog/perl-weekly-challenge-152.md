## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to `Week #152`, a rather quiet one, where we received `68 regular` contributions and `45 guest` contributions. It didn't trouble me much, which is good in a way. Hopefully it would bounce back this week.

`Just an update, I am working on the design of the T-shirt. I will update you with regard to the design as soon as I am done."

Good luck with the fun tasks.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Triangle Sum Path {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

You are given a triangle array.

Write a script to find the minimum sum path from top to bottom.

### Example 1:

    Input: $triangle = [ [1], [5,3], [2,3,4], [7,1,0,2], [6,4,5,2,8] ]

                    1
                   5 3
                  2 3 4
                 7 1 0 2
                6 4 5 2 8

    Output: 8

        Minimum Sum Path = 1 + 3 + 2 + 0 + 2 => 8

### Example 2:

    Input: $triangle = [ [5], [2,3], [4,1,5], [0,1,2,3], [7,2,4,1,9] ]

                    5
                   2 3
                  4 1 5
                 0 1 2 3
                7 2 4 1 9

    Output: 9

        Minimum Sum Path = 5 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 => 9

<br>

## TASK #2 › Rectangle Area {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

You are given coordinates bottom-left and top-right corner of two rectangles in a 2D plane.

Write a script to find the total area covered by the two rectangles.

### Example 1:

    Input: Rectangle 1 => (-1,0), (2,2)
           Rectangle 2 => (0,-1), (4,4)

    Output: 22

### Example 2:

    Input: Rectangle 1 => (-3,-1), (1,3)
           Rectangle 2 => (-1,-3), (2,2)

    Output: 25
