## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to yet another week full of `factorials left right center`. The magic of factorials did the trick. For the first time in the history of weekly challenge, we have received more `guest contributions` than the `regular contributions`. Two contributors stand out in the crowd, although every contributor is special. `Abigail` and `Laurent Rosenfeld`, you must have guessed it by now. I would like to thank `Laurent` for being one of the few who have been with us from day one. I would also like to thank him for the final push to get over the magic target.

While I am talking about guest contributions, I would like to thank `Bruce Gray` for introducing a new guest language `WebAssembly` and shared his [**contributions**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-153/bruce-gray/webassembly).

At the time of releasing the weekly challenge, we received `106 guest contributions` as compared to `90 regular contributions`. Still the regular contributions beat the last week number i.e. `78 regular contributions`. I hope we can reverse the number this week.

As for my own contributions, I could only do [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-153/mohammad-anwar/perl) this week because of lack of time. Having said, I would definitely try the challenge in **Raku** and **Python** if time permits this week.

All the best for the weekly challenge, I hope you like it. Please do share your suggestions for the upcoming weekly challenges.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Missing Permutation {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

You are given possible permutations of the string `'PERL'`.

    PELR, PREL, PERL, PRLE, PLER, PLRE, EPRL, EPLR, ERPL,
    ERLP, ELPR, ELRP, RPEL, RPLE, REPL, RELP, RLPE, RLEP,
    LPER, LPRE, LEPR, LRPE, LREP

Write a script to find any permutations missing from the list.

<br>

## TASK #2 › Padovan Prime {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

A `Padovan Prime` is a `Padovan Number` that's also prime.

In number theory, the Padovan sequence is the sequence of integers P(n) defined by the initial values.

    P(0) = P(1) = P(2) = 1

and then followed by

    P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3)

First few `Padovan Numbers` are as below:

    1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 16, 21, 28, 37, ...

Write a script to compute first `10 distinct Padovan Primes`.

### Expected Output

    2, 3, 5, 7, 37, 151, 3329, 23833, 13091204281, 3093215881333057
