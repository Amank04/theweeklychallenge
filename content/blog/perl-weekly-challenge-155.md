## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #155`. It is hard to believe the number. At times I feel like taking short break from the routine that I have been following for the last `3 years` (almost). But then when I read the positive comments week after week by the dedicated members, I drop the idea completely. Here are some for you.

<br>

### 1. [Ulrich Rieke](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/meet-the-champion-033)

>  thank you for the fine tasks this week! Apparently, the prime number theme offers quite a number of variations. For me, trying to solve the tasks was a little distraction from the endless and permanent stream of sad news from the east of our common continent.

### 2. [Duncan C. White](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/meet-the-champion-020)

> first nice and easy, second finds the first 8 Padovan Primes quickly, doesn't find 9th or 10th PP in reasonable time and space.

### 3. [Flavio Poletti](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/meet-the-champion-2021-07)

> Hi! Please find my contribution for this week's challenge. Thanks for all the energy!

### 4. Marton Polgar

> thank you for the challenges as usual; very interesting second task indeed, as gfldex pointed out. :)

<br>

It is not that everything is rosy but lets change the topic.

First `Monday` of the month and time to declare another champion. It gives me immense pleasure to announce, `Robert DiCicco`, as our next champion. He is relative new to the team but in a short time he has become very prominent contributor. As of today, he has contributed `29 Perl` and `6 Raku` solutions. He is currently `ranked #37` in the `Guest Leaders` board. He has so far contributed `6 Ruby` and `4 Tcl` solutions.

Let us welcome another member to the team, [**Jeff Armstrong**](https://github.com/jaguart). He shared his [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-154/jaguart/raku) solutions in the first week. `Thank You`.

Talking about contributions, I missed the opportunity to contribute once again. I always encourage others to contribute to `Task #1` at least if they are running short of time since it usually doesn't take much time. Here I am, not following my own advice. I am going through many ups and downs in my head right now. I will get back to the track soon, promise.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Fortunate Numbers {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

Write a script to produce first `8 Fortunate Numbers` (unique and sorted).

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortunate_number)

> A Fortunate number, named after Reo Fortune, is the smallest integer m > 1 such that, for a given positive integer n, pn# + m is a prime number, where the primorial pn# is the product of the first n prime numbers.

### Expected Output

    3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 23, 37

<br>

## TASK #2 › Pisano Period {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

Write a script to find the period of the `3rd Pisano Period`.

> In number theory, the nth Pisano period, written as π(n), is the period with which the sequence of Fibonacci numbers taken modulo n repeats.

The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the integer sequence:

    0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, ...

For any integer n, the sequence of Fibonacci numbers F(i) taken modulo n is periodic. The Pisano period, denoted π(n), is the value of the period of this sequence. For example, the sequence of Fibonacci numbers modulo 3 begins:

    0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1,
    0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1,
    0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, ...

This sequence has period 8, so π(3) = 8.
