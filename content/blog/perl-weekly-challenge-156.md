## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome [**Daniel Pfeiffer**] to the **Team PWC**. We are now strong team of `252 members`.

The interview with our latest champion, [**Robert DiCicco**](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/meet-the-champion-2022-02), is live now. It was great knowing him. `Robert` is so lucky to be able to spend time coding even after retirement. Ideally I would also want to spend my time with **Perl** post retirement. Given a choice, I would retire today and spend every minute doing **Perl**. Having said, I know I have responsibilities and I have to fulfill it with utmost sincerity.

In my experience, when I enjoy what I do then life is super fun. I also know,  not every day can be the same. In the current time, it is very important to keep the negative thoughts away. Running the weekly challenge contest helps me a lot. All credit goes to every members of **Team PWC**. Unfortunately another week gone and no time to contribute to the weekly challenge. Luckily there was plenty of contributions by the team members. Above all, the [**Perl Review**](/blog/review-challenge-151) by `Colin Crain` kept me engaged. When I see my name mentioned in the review then it is always a pride moment for me.

Last `3 weeks` contributions by **Team PWC** are `95`, `104` and `97`. The numbers are very encouraging. Even guest contributions of last `3 weeks` are `116`, `73` and `87`. Overall contributions in the last `3 years` (nearly) is `14,310`.

Last but not least, I am little busy these days and hence the delay in the design/order of `T-shirt` for the big event. Please bear with me.

Have fun with the weekly challenge. Please do share your ideas to make it fun for everyone.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Pernicious Numbers {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

Write a script to permute first `10 Pernicious Numbers`.

> A pernicious number is a positive integer which has prime number of ones in its binary representation.

The first pernicious number is 3 since binary representation of 3 = (11) and 1 + 1 = 2, which is a prime.

### Expected Output

    3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

<br>

## TASK #2 › Weird Number {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

You are given number, `$n > 0`.

Write a script to find out if the given number is a `Weird Number`.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_number), it is defined as:

> The sum of the proper divisors (divisors including 1 but not itself) of the number is greater than the number, but no subset of those divisors sums to the number itself.

### Example 1:

    Input: $n = 12
    Output: 0

    Since the proper divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which sum to 16; but 2 + 4 + 6 = 12.

### Example 2:

    Input: $n = 70
    Output: 1

    As the proper divisors of 70 are 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 35; these sum to 74, but no subset of these sums to 70.
