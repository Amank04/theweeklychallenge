## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome `Kueppo Wesley` to the **Team PWC**. Thank you for the impressive introduction as below.

<br>

    My name is KUEPPO Wesley and I live in Africa/Cameroon/Yaounde, I'm 20 yrs/old, the first born out of 7.

    I'm a student at the University of Yaounde I, level 3, preparing for my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I started Computer Science in 2019, back then I never really knew what it was, I only mastered C, sh, and Awk. I barely scratched the surface of Python, Javascript and C++, I learnt them just for school stuffs and I fell in love with Perl and Raku some months ago.

    My chosen fields are Operating systems and Computer Networks.

    I'm living in anguish, the reason why I'm so slow but by the end of this academic year, I have as objective to master the development of web back-end systems (in Perl and Javascript) and DevOps so that at the end I might be able to get a job from Perl jobs.

    My parents are planning to move me to Belgium so I can have more opportunities and support them.

    Perl Projects I'm currently working on are

        1. Paranoid, an ncurses based system resource monitoring tool.
        2. Krit, a HEAD/GET/POST/PUT/DELETE web server.
        3. My blog (with Mojo).

    Perl, Raku and AWK are my programming languages of interest in solving the weekly challenge but apart from that I'm also fully interested in Posix sh, C, Rust, Lua, Javascript, and Typescript.

<br>

`Kueppo Wesley` first contributions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-156/kueppo-wesley/perl) is impressive. Not only that but we also got 2 blog posts one each for [**Task #1**](https://wesleykueppo-new.bearblog.dev/perniciouspl) and [**Task #2**](https://wesleykueppo-new.bearblog.dev/weird-number). I am looking forward to `Colin`'s verdict when he gets to review his contributions.

After a gap of `2 weeks`, I finally got the time to contribute in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-156/mohammad-anwar/perl/ch-1.pl) and [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-156/mohammad-anwar/raku/ch-1.raku).

Thanks [**Duncan C. White**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/pull/5801) for the encouraging words. It means a world to me.

    I liked the first task a lot, struggled slightly with the second just because I was a bit tired. Overall took 1h30m or so.

<br>

Thank you, `W. Luis Mochan`, for the fun one-liner in **Raku** for the task `Pernicious Numbers`.

<br>

    raku -e 'say (1..Inf).grep({is-prime([+] split "", sprintf "%b", $_)})[^10]'

<br>

I would like to thank `PokGoPun` for regularly contributing in [**Go**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-156/pokgopun/go). It gives me immense pleasure to see members contributing in guest languages too. We had `10 contributors` sharing solutions in guest languages last week.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Pythagorean Means {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

You are given a set of integers.

Write a script to compute all three `Pythagorean Means` i.e **Arithmetic Mean**, **Geometric Mean** and **Harmonic Mean** of the given set of integers. Please refer to wikipedia [**page**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_means) for more informations.

### Example 1:

    Input: @n = (1,3,5,6,9)
    Output: AM = 4.8, GM = 3.8, HM = 2.8

##### CORRECTION [2022-03-21 16:35] GM = 3.9 (before)

<br>

### Example 2:

    Input: @n = (2,4,6,8,10)
    Output: AM = 6.0, GM = 5.2, HM = 4.4

### Example 3:

    Input: @n = (1,2,3,4,5)
    Output: AM = 3.0, GM = 2.6, HM = 2.2

<br>

## TASK #2 › Brazilian Number {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org/)
***

You are given a number `$n > 3`.

Write a script to find out if the given number is a `Brazilian Number`.

> A positive integer number N has at least one natural number B where 1 < B < N-1 where the representation of N in base B has same digits.

<br>

### Example 1:

    Input: $n = 7
    Output: 1

    Since 7 in base 2 is 111.


### Example 2:

    Input: $n = 6
    Output: 0

    Since 6 in base 2 is 110,
          6 in base 3 is 20 and
          6 in base 4 is 12.

### Example 3:

    Input: $n = 8
    Output: 1

    Since 8 in base 3 is 22.
