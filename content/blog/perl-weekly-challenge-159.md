## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the first weekly challenge of the holy month of `Ramadan`.

Also today is the first Monday of the month and time to announce the next champion. With great pleasure I announce, `Eric Cheung`, as the **Champion of the month**. `Eric` is currently `ranked #11` in the **Guest Leaderboard**. As of today he has contributed `78 solutions`. The breakdown of his contributions are `63 Excel VBA` and `15 Python` solutions.

Last few days have been really tough as I am having really bad cold. Somehow I managed to contribute to the last week challenge. I hope to continue as long as humanly possible.

After a gap of `3 weeks`, we breached the target once again. Last time we reached the target (106) was in the `Week 154`. This week we had `105` contributions, thanks to each and every contributors.

Enjoy !!!

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.
