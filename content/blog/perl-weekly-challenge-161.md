## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}

Welcome to yet another fun weekly challenge.

We had the pleasure to interview our latest champion, [**Eric Cheung**](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/meet-the-champion-2022-03).

There was another surprise, pleasant one, we had last week. Our ex-Perl Reviewer, `Ryan J Thompson`, got in touch with us. It is always a pleasure to hear you, `Ryan` and thanks for proposing interesting tasks for the `Week 161`.

Last week, two new guest languages, `Elixir` and `YaBasic` introduced to the `Team PWC`, thanks to [**Maxim Kolodyazhny**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-160/maxim-kolodyazhny/elixir/four_is_magic.ex) and [**Bruce Gray**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-160/bruce-gray/yabasic), respectively.

After a long time, we had `15 contributors` to the guest languages. Although we couldn't even reach the half way mark, still it is promising.

Welcome back, `Mohammad Meraj Zia`, after the break and sharing [**Java**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-160/ziameraj16/java/EquilibriumIndex.java) solution.

Welcome back, `Olivier Delouya` and thanks for sharing [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-160/olivier-delouya/perl/ch-2.sh) solution after the break.

Welcome back, `Andinus`, after the break and thanks for your contributions in [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-160/andinus/raku) and [**blog post**](https://andinus.unfla.me/pwc/challenge-160/).

Last but not least, I would like to thank `Paulo Custodio` for solving past challenges. Thanks for your support and encouragements.

I also managed to contribute in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-160/mohammad-anwar/perl/ch-1.pl) and [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-160/mohammad-anwar/raku/ch-1.raku) this week.

As far as regular contributions, we back again with the force. We had `114 contributions` this week. Last time we had more contributions `(116)` than this was in the `Week 120`.

There has been delay in getting the T-shirt design for the `1000 days` celebration. In the meantime, we got 3 more champions declared. I would invite the new additions to be part of the celebration. As of today, I have `32 confirmations`. With 3 more, it would be `35 confirmations` hopefully. I will keep you informed. Sorry for the delay.

Good luck with the challenge.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2022. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Abecedarian Words
##### **Submitted by:** [Ryan J Thompson](https://ry.ca)
***

An `abecedarian word` is a word whose letters are arranged in alphabetical order. For example, "knotty" is an abecedarian word, but "knots" is not. Output or return a list of all abecedarian words in the [dictionary](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/data/dictionary.txt), sorted in decreasing order of length.

Optionally, using only abecedarian words, leave a short comment in your code to make your reviewer smile.

<br>

## Task 2: Pangrams
##### **Submitted by:** [Ryan J Thompson](https://ry.ca)
***

A pangram is a sentence or phrase that uses every letter in the English alphabet at least once. For example, perhaps the most well known pangram is:

    the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

Using the provided [dictionary](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/data/dictionary.txt), so that you don't need to include individual copy, generate at least `one pangram`.

Your pangram does not have to be a syntactically valid English sentence (doing so would require far more work, and a dictionary of nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and conjunctions). Also note that repeated letters, and even repeated words, are permitted.

#### BONUS: Constrain or optimize for something interesting (completely up to you), such as:

    Shortest possible pangram (difficult)
    Pangram which contains only abecedarian words (see challenge 1)
    Pangram such that each word "solves" exactly one new letter. For example, such a pangram might begin with (newly solved letters in bold):
        a ah hi hid die ice tea ...
        What is the longest possible pangram generated with this method? (All solutions will contain 26 words, so focus on the letter count.)
    Pangrams that have the weirdest (PG-13) Google image search results
    Anything interesting goes!
