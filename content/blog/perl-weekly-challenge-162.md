## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}

`Time flies by so fast`, it is unbelievable, we are now in the `Week #162`.

Let us all welcome new member, `Rick Bychowski`, from California and thank you for your first contributions in [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-161/rick-bychowski/raku).

We also had, `Ryan Thompson`, back in action. What a pleasant surprise. Not only he shared solutions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-161/ryan-thompson/perl) but also shared blogs for [**Task #1**](https://ry.ca/2022/04/abecedarian-words) and [**Task #2**](https://ry.ca/2022/04/pangrams). Those who don't know, `Ryan Thompson`, he was our `Perl Reviewer` for a long time. Please checkout the [**interview**](/blog/meet-the-champion-038) with him, if you have time.

`Colin Crain`, our current `Perl Reviewer`, seems very busy this week as he could only do [**Task #1**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-161/colin-crain/perl/ch-1.pl) in `Perl`. Usually he does both tasks in `Perl` and `Raku` with `two blogs` each for the task, every week. Having said, he did manage to review `Perl` solutions for the [**Week #157**](/blog/review-challenge-157). Hopefully he would be back in action fully next week.

Last week was a special one for one more reason, `Julien Fiegehenn`, a very close friend of mine and work colleague (both of us work for [**Oleeo**](https://www.oleeo.com/)) shared [**solutions**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-161/julien-fiegehenn/perl) in `Perl`, after a long time.

As far as my contribution, I could only do [**Task #1**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-161/mohammad-anwar/perl/ch-1.pl) in `Perl`. I could have done the same in `Raku` but didn't have any energy left. `Ramadan` is taking its toll. One more week left, it is likely next `Monday` we would celebrate `Idd` in England.

Last week, we couldn't reach target but I am very happy to see consistent `30+` participants every week. Above all the quality of code is very high. Blogging is also on high, last week we had `20 blogs`, thank you each and every member for the support and encouragement. Outside of the weekly challenge zone, I hardly see anyone blog about `Perl` and I am telling this being co-editor of `Perl Weekly` newsletter. So well done `Team PWC` for keeping the flame alive.

I just noticed my rank in the `Leader Board` slipped by 2 positions to `17th`. I would blame two fellow members, `Paulo Custodio` and `Duncan C. White` for being consistent contributors. I really have to push harder now to maintain my position.

For those, who don't know, we have `Early Bird Club`, where members get first peek of the upcoming challenges. If you are interested to join the club then please send me one line message to `perlweeklychallenge@yahoo.com`.

Also I would like to request fellow members to suggest fun and interesting challenges if you know any. It would be a big help.

Good luck for this week challenge.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2022. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: ISBN-13 {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

Write a script to generate the check digit of given ISBN-13 code. Please refer [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number#ISBN-13_check_digit_calculation) for more information.

##### Example

    ISBN-13 check digit for '978-0-306-40615-7' is 7.

<br>

## Task 2: Wheatstone-Playfair {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Roger Bell_West](https://blog.firedrake.org)
***

Implement encryption and decryption using [the Wheatstone-Playfair cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher).

##### Examples:

    (These combine I and J, and use X as padding.)

    encrypt("playfair example", "hide the gold in the tree stump") = "bmodzbxdnabekudmuixmmouvif"

    decrypt("perl and raku", "siderwrdulfipaarkcrw") = "thewexeklychallengex"
