## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}

Welcome to the `Week #164` with new member `Luiz Felipe` from `Brazil`. Thank you, `Luiz` for your first contributions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-163/luiz-felipe/perl).

Thank you, `Ryan Thompson` for the contributions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-163/ryan-thompson/perl) and [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-163/ryan-thompson/raku).

I should also thank, `Julien Fiegehenn` for the contributions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-163/julien-fiegehenn/perl).

After a long time, I managed to submit the solutions to both tasks in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-163/mohammad-anwar/perl).

Guest contributions picked up once again as we had `47 contributions` in `18 different languages`. Thank you all guest contributors.

I would like to talk about `Perl Reviews` by our in-house expert, `Colin Crain`. I am not sure about other team members, but every time I contribute, I always look forward to what `Colin` has to say about my contributions. It is not that I am lucky all the time but I do get mention in the review once in a while. It makes me very happy every time I do receive positive review.

`Colin Crain` shared some interesting stats about recently done `Perl Reviews`.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2022. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

<br>

## Task 1: Prime Palindrome {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

Write a script to find all prime numbers less than 1000, which are also palindromes in base 10. Palindromic numbers are numbers whose digits are the same in reverse. For example, **313** is a palindromic prime, but **337** is not, even though **733** (337 reversed) is also prime.

<br>

## Task 2: Happy Numbers {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Robert DiCicco](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/meet-the-champion-2022-02/)
***

Write a script to find the **first 8 Happy Numbers** in base 10. For more information, please check out [**Wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_number).

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.

Those numbers for which this process end in 1 are happy numbers, while those numbers that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers.

##### Example

19 is Happy Number in base 10, as shown:

    19 => 1^2 + 9^2
       => 1   + 81
       => 82 => 8^2 + 2^2
             => 64  + 4
             => 68 => 6^2 + 8^2
                   => 36  + 64
                   => 100 => 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2
                          => 1 + 0 + 0
                          => 1
