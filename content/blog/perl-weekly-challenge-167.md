## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #167` and I got the opportunity to propose the challenge.

For me the main attraction was the [**blog post**](https://simbabque.github.io/posts/weekly-challenge-166-github-copilot/) by `Julien Fiegehenn` for the first time.

`Colin Crain` seems to be busy as we didn't get the blog post 2 weeks in a row. However, `Ryan Thompson` is filling up the space for now. I am so greatful to all those who blog about their solutions. I know how much effort it takes to get one out.

Sadly, I haven't participated in the weekly challenge for 2 weeks in a row. What a shame !!! I aim to do at least one task, even that didn't happen. I am hoping to get back on track this week. Please wish me luck. I am going through low phase right now, so just taking it easy. My TODO list keeps growing and not much happening unfortunately. I avoid looking at my own TODO list as it is embarassing. I pretend never seen it. Not sure how long it would carry on like this. I stopped adding any new items to the TODO list.

I would like to thank `James Smith` for his contributions. I would highly recommend you do checkout his work as he always goes beyond what is needed. It takes a lot of time to get to that. He has been doing this for weeks now.

Similary for guest contributions, `Roger Bell_West`, is leading the pack. I used to contribute in `Swift`, `Python` and `Java` but not anymore. So I can relate how much time and energy it takes to do all of these week after week.

`PokGoPun` is on the loose apparently as he is not doing solving the current weekly challenge in `Go` but also the past weekly challenges. He (I am assuming) is already gone past me in the guest leader board. Well done.

Good luck for the next challenge.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2022. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Circular Prime {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

Write a script to find out first `10 circular primes` having at least 3 digits (base 10).

Please checkout [**wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_prime) for more information.

<br>

> A circular prime is a prime number with the property that the number generated at each intermediate step when cyclically permuting its (base 10) digits will also be prime.

<br>

##### Output

    113, 197, 199, 337, 1193, 3779, 11939, 19937, 193939, 199933

<br>

## Task 2: Gamma Function {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

Implement subroutine `gamma()` using the [**Lanczos approximation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_approximation) method.

<br>

##### Example

    print gamma(3); # 1.99
    print gamma(5); # 24
    print gamma(7); # 719.99
