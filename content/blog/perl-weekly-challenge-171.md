## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to `Week #171` of the weekly challenge.

Let us all welcome another experienced **Perl** hacker from **France**, [**Philippe Bricout**](https://github.com/brxfork). You should definitely checkout his [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-170/brxfork/perl/ch-1.sh) solution.

Welcome back, `Mark Senn` and thanks for your contribution in [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-170/mark-senn/raku/ch-1.raku).

Welcome back `Cristina Heredia` and thank you for your contributions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-170/cristian-heredia/perl/ch-1.pl) and [**Python**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-170/cristian-heredia/python/ch-1.py).

`E. Choroba` shared [**link**](https://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=11144888) about his discussion he initiated on `PerlMonks`. It is worth taking a look, plenty of new ideas shared.

Thank you, `Stephen G Lynn` for sharing his first [**blog post**](https://thiujiac.blogspot.com/2022/06/pwc-170.html).

At last, I found the time to take part in the weekly challenge and shared solutions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-170/mohammad-anwar/perl/ch-1.pl), [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-170/mohammad-anwar/raku/ch-1.raku) and [**Python**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-170/mohammad-anwar/python/ch-1.py).

With regard to the `1000 days` celebration update, I have reached out to the recently declared champions i.e. `Alexander Pankoff`, `Robert DiCicco`, `Eric Cheung`, `Matthew Neleigh` and `Robert Ransbottom`. It is likely I am going to add one more champion to the list, to be declared next week. I will give them couple of weeks to respond to my email. And then the final list would be prepared.

Good luck for the next challenge.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2022. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Abundant Number {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

Write a script to generate first `20 Abundant Odd Numbers`.

According to [**wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundant_number),

<br>

> A number n for which the sum of divisors Ïƒ(n) > 2n, or, equivalently, the sum of proper divisors (or aliquot sum) s(n) > n.

<br>

For example, `945` is the first `Abundant Odd Number`.

    Sum of divisors:
    1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 15 + 21 + 27 + 35 + 45 + 63 + 105 + 135 + 189 + 315 = 975

<br>

## Task 2: First-class Function {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

Create `sub compose($f, $g)` which takes in two parameters `$f` and `$g` as subroutine refs and returns subroutine ref i.e. `compose($f, $g)->($x) = $f->($g->($x))`

<br>

e.g.

    $f = (one or more parameters function)
    $g = (one or more parameters function)

    $h = compose($f, $g)
    $f->($g->($x,$y, ..)) == $h->($x, $y, ..) for any $x, $y, ...
