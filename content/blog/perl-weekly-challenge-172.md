## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to `Week #172` of the weekly challenge.

Today is the first `Monday` of the month and time to announce the champion. Proud to declare `PokGoPun` as our next champion. He is relatively new to the `Team PWC`. In such a short time, he has reached `rank #12` in `Guest Leaders`. His contributing languages are `Perl` and `Go`.

We have done interview with the last champion, `Robert Ransbottom`, please checkout and find out more about him in the [**interview**](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/meet-the-champion-2022-05).

Recently `brian d foy` contacted me and offered signed hard copy of his latest `Perl` book i.e. [**Learning Perl, 8th edition**](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-perl-8th/9781492094944). I am given free hand to nominate the member to receive the `FREE` book and delivered too at no extra cost. I am happy to nominate, `Colin Crain`, our most popular and famous `Perl Reviewer`. I will share the details with `brian d foy` in the next few days. Next week, we are going to have another nomination.

Thanks to the contributions of `Team PWC`, we have reached the milestone of `100+` contributions `3 weeks in a row`. Even the guest contributions also peaked after a long time with `75 contributions` in `25 languages` by `15 guests`.

Welcome back, `Bartosz Jarzyna` and thanks for sharing solutions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-171/brtastic/perl), [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-171/brtastic/raku), [**C**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-171/brtastic/c) and [**Pascal**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-171/brtastic/pascal).

Welcome back, `Humberto Massa` after a short break. Thank you for contribtions in [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-171/massa/raku).

Welcome back, `Kjetil Skotheim` and thanks for sharing solutions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-171/kjetillll/perl).

Even, I got the time to do both, [**Task #1**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-171/mohammad-anwar/perl/ch-1.pl) and [**Task #2**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-171/mohammad-anwar/perl/ch-2.pl) this week in `Perl`, usually I have only time for `Task #1`.

Last but not the least, we have received the confirmation from champions contacted recently. Altogether, we now have confirmations from `38 champions`. One more champion is going to be added to the list i.e. `PokGoPun`. As soon as I get the confirmation, I will get the `T-shirt` printing ordered. You can checkout the latest update in the [**blog post**](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/1000-days).

Good luck for the next challenge.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2022. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Prime Partition {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)

You are given two positive integers, `$m` and `$n`.

Write a script to find out the `Prime Partition` of the given number. No duplicates allowed.

For example,

    Input: $m = 18, $n = 2
    Output: 5, 13 or 7, 11

    Input: $m = 19, $n = 3
    Output: 3, 5, 11

##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers.

Write a script to compute the `five-number summary` of the given set of integers.

You can find the definition and example in the [**wikipedia page**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-number_summary).
