## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}

Welcome to `Week #173` of the weekly challenge.

I nominate, [**Ryan Thompson**](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/meet-the-champion-038) for the signed copy of [**Learning Perl, 8th edition**](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-perl-8th/9781492094944) by `brian d foy`. Next week, we are going to have one more nomination.

After a very long time, I finally managed to find time for both tasks in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-172/mohammad-anwar/perl), [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-172/mohammad-anwar/raku) and [**Python**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-172/mohammad-anwar/python). There is still something that I have been looking forward to do i.e. `YouTube Video` live coding. You can watch my past videos in the dedicated [**YouTube Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/c/mohammadsajidanwar).

As we declared `PokGoPun` last week, champion of the weekly challenge, I have sent an email to him requesting his details. Hopefully we will have altogether `39 champions`, assuming we get the confirmation from `PokGoPun` soon. The total number `T-shirts` to be ordered is going to be `40`.

Good luck for the next challenge.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2022. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Esthetic Number {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a positive integer, `$n`.

Write a script to find out if the given number is `Esthetic Number`.

<br>

> An esthetic number is a positive integer where every adjacent digit differs from its neighbour by 1.

<br>

For example,

    5456 is an esthetic number as |5 - 4| = |4 - 5| = |5 - 6| = 1
    120 is not an esthetic numner as |1 - 2| != |2 - 0| != 1

<br>

## Task 2: Sylvester's sequence {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

Write a script to generate first `10 members` of `Sylvester's sequence`. For more informations, please refer to the [**wikipedia page**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester%27s_sequence).
