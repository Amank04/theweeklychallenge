Welcome to `Week #174` of the weekly challenge.

I nominate, [**Roger Bell_West**](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/meet-the-champion-026) for the signed copy of [**Learning Perl, 8th edition**](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-perl-8th/9781492094944) by `brian d foy`. This is the last copy we had, so a big `Thank You` to `brian d foy` for the generous offer.

`Laurent Rosenfeld` is on mission of some kind as he shared the maximum guest solutions i.e. `27`. He also introduced a new guest language, `Dc`. Not only he shared solutions in [**Dc**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-173/laurent-rosenfeld/dc/ch-2.dc) but also wrote a dedicated [**blog post**](http://blogs.perl.org/users/laurent_r/2022/07/perl-weekly-challenge-173-sylvesters-sequence-in-dc.html) sharing the background of the new language. He is currently `ranked #6` in the `Guest Leaders Board` and `ranked #1` in the `Team Leaders Board`.

I would like mention two members of `Team PWC` i.e. [**Athanasius**](/blog/meet-the-champion-023) and [**E. Choroba**](/blog/meet-the-champion-018) for the contributions week after week consistently. It is not just solutions but quality solutions. Don't believe me? Take a look at [**Reviews**](/p5-reviews) by `Colin Crain`.

As I understand, holiday season is going on, some of the regular team members also taking a well deserved break. I noticed this when [**Luca Ferrari**](/blog/meet-the-champion-2020-04) suddenly disappeared from the scene. Luckily he is back again wit his [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-173/luca-ferrari/raku) and [**PostgreSQL**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-173/luca-ferrari/postgresql). He is a regular blogger too, so we had [**blog post**](https://fluca1978.github.io/2022/07/11/PerlWeeklyChallenge173.html) as well.

`Roger Bell_West` is on holiday too but being a member of `Early Bird Club` he had access to the future tasks in advance. Therfore we had his contributions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-173/roger-bell-west/perl) and [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-173/roger-bell-west/raku). He is a regular guest contributors as well, so we had varieties of solutions in [**JavaScript**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-173/roger-bell-west/javascript), [**Kotlin**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-173/roger-bell-west/kotlin), [**Lua**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-173/roger-bell-west/lua), [**Postscript**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-173/roger-bell-west/postscript), [**Python**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-173/roger-bell-west/python), [**Ruby**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-173/roger-bell-west/ruby) and [**Rust**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-173/roger-bell-west/rust). We had the bonus on top of that, a [**blog post**](https://blog.firedrake.org/archive/2022/07/The_Weekly_Challenge_173__The_Aesthetics_of_Sylvester.html). No wonder, he is `ranked #2` in the `Team Leaders` and `Guest Leaders`.

In `Week #172`, I shared solutions to both tasks in `Perl` and `Raku`. It was great a feeling. Now in the `Week #173`, I repeated the same, solved both tasks in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-173/mohammad-anwar/perl) and [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-173/mohammad-anwar/raku). Also like last time, I shared solutions in [**Python**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-173/mohammad-anwar/python). This time, I even had time to do both tasks in [**Java**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-173/mohammad-anwar/java/theweeklychallenge) and just one in [**Swift**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-173/mohammad-anwar/swift/ch-1.swift).

Atlast, I have the final list of champions for the `1000 days` celebration. The latest champion `PokGoPun` has shared the details. So now we have altogether `39 champions`. It is time to place the order of specially designed `T-shirt`. The credit goes to `Lance Wicks` for the design.

Good luck for the next challenge.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2022. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Disarium Numbers {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

Write a script to generate first `19 Disarium Numbers`.

<br>

> A disarium number is an integer where the sum of each digit raised to the power of its position in the number, is equal to the number.

<br>

For example,

    518 is a disarium number as (5 ** 1) + (1 ** 2) + (8 ** 3) => 5 + 1 + 512 => 518

<br>

## Task 2: Permutation Ranking {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a list of integers with no duplicates, e.g. `[0, 1, 2]`.

Write two functions, `permutation2rank()` which will take the list and determine its rank (starting at 0) in the set of possible permutations arranged in lexicographic order, and `rank2permutation()` which will take the list and a rank number and produce just that permutation.

Please checkout this [**post**](https://tryalgo.org/en/permutations/2016/09/05/permutation-rank) for more informations and algorithm.

Given the list `[0, 1, 2]` the ordered permutations are:

    0: [0, 1, 2]
    1: [0, 2, 1]
    2: [1, 0, 2]
    3: [1, 2, 0]
    4: [2, 0, 1]
    5: [2, 1, 0]

and therefore:

    permutation2rank([1, 0, 2]) = 2

    rank2permutation([0, 1, 2], 1) = [0, 2, 1]
