Welcome to `Week #177` of the weekly challenge.

Please checkout the interview with our champion [**PokGoPun**](/blog/meet-the-champion-2022-06).

I forgot to mention that `Dave Cross` is back in action last week. Two weeks in a row, [**Week 175**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-175/dave-cross/perl) and [**Week 176**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-176/dave-cross/perl), incredible. `Thank You`.

`Laurent Rosenfeld`, thank you for the maximum guest contributions, `21 solutions` in `16 different` languages.

Altogether we received `85 solutions` by `17 contributors`.

`Cheok-Yin Fung` sharing solutions in [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-176/cheok-yin-fung/raku) for the first time. Well done.

`W. Luis Mochan` also shared solutions in [**Emacs Lisp**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-176/wlmb/emacs-lisp) for the first time. It was his first guest contributions, congratulations.

I was fortunate to share solutions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-176/mohammad-anwar/perl), [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-176/mohammad-anwar/raku), [**Python**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-176/mohammad-anwar/python), [**Java**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-176/mohammad-anwar/java/theweeklychallenge) and [**Swift**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-176/mohammad-anwar/swift) once again.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2022. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.
