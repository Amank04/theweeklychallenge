## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}

Welcome to `Week #178` of the weekly challenge.

We have two new members joining the `Team PWC` last week i.e. [**AhmetEmre**](https://github.com/aecepoglu) and [**Aut0exec**](https://github.com/aut0exec). Thank you `AhmetEmre` for solutions in [**BQN**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-177/aecepoglu/bqn) and `Aut0exec` for solution in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-177/aut0exec/perl).

Please checkout the interview with our latest champion [**Marton Polgar**](/blog/meet-the-champion-2022-07).

The two weekly newsletters, one for [**Perl**](https://perlweekly.com) and another for [**Raku**](https://rakudoweekly.blog/blog-feed) regularly feature the weekly challenge. I am gratefull to both `Gabor Szabo` and `Elizabeth Mattijsen` for giving us space every week.

Few days ago, `brain d foy`, contacted me with the offer of `50 coupons` for his latest creation, [**Learning Perl Exercises**](https://leanpub.com/learning_perl_exercises). I have decided to gift one token every week to one lucky member of `Team PWC`.

So the `Token #1` is given to `Cheok-Yin Fung`. I will share the details with you separately in an email, congratulations.

`Laurent Rosenfeld`, thank you for sharing the collection of guest contributions, `26 solutions` in `19 different` languages.

Altogether we received `73 solutions` by `14 contributors`.

Happy to share my solutions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-177/mohammad-anwar/perl), [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-177/mohammad-anwar/raku), [**Python**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-177/mohammad-anwar/python), [**Java**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-177/mohammad-anwar/java/theweeklychallenge) and [**Swift**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-177/mohammad-anwar/swift).

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2022. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Quater-imaginary Base {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

Write a script to convert a given number (base 10) to quater-imaginary base number and vice-versa. For more informations, please checkout [**wiki page**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quater-imaginary_base).

For example,

    $number_base_10 = 4
    $number_quater_imaginary_base = 10300

<br>

## Task 2: Business Date {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given `$timestamp` (date with time) and `$duration` in hours.

Write a script to find the time that occurs `$duration` business hours after `$timestamp`. For the sake of this task, let us assume the working hours is 9am to 6pm, Monday to Friday. Please ignore timezone too.

For example,

    Suppose the given timestamp is 2022-08-01 10:30 and the duration is 4 hours.
    Then the next business date would be 2022-08-01 14:30.

    Similar if the given timestamp is 2022-08-01 17:00 and the duration is 3.5 hours.
    Then the next business date would be 2022-08-02 11:30.
