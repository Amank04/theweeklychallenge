## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to `Week #179` of the weekly challenge.

Let us all welcome new member, `Solathian`, an experienced `Perl` hacker. Thank you for the first solution in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-178/solathian/perl/ch-2.pl).

Thank you, `AhmetEmre`, for the first contributions in [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-178/aecepoglu/raku).

Today, we are giving away `Token #2` to `W. Luis Mochan` for the book, [**Learning Perl Exercises**](https://leanpub.com/learning_perl_exercises) by `brian d foy`. I will share the details with you in a separate email.

This week, I didn't have time to contribute to the weekly challenge. Although I did start on `Business Date` task but it still had some edge case issues. I will share when I am done later this week.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2022. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.
