## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to `Week #180` of the weekly challenge.

Today, we are giving away `Token #3` to `Robert DiCicco` for the book, [**Learning Perl Exercises**](https://leanpub.com/learning_perl_exercises) by `brian d foy`. I will share the details with you in a separate email.

Second consecutive week, I took break from weekly challenge. The end result, I am dropped to `rank #16` in the leader board. Luckily less competition in `Guest Leader Board`, I am still holding my `rank #15`. Hopefully next week, I will try to participate. It has been the most busiest week for me.

Full credit goes to `Laurent Rosenfeld`, for holding the `rank #1` for the longest period. I don't see imminent threat to his position. As far as `Guest Leader Board` is concerned, `Abigail` is by far way ahead of everyone. Although he has taken break for the time being, still his position is quite safe.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2022. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: First Unique Character {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a string, `$s`.

Write a script to find out the first unique character in the given string and print its index (0-based).

#### Example 1

    Input: $s = "Perl Weekly Challenge"
    Output: 0 as 'P' is the first unique character

#### Example 2

    Input: $s = "Long Live Perl"
    Output: 1 as 'o' is the first unique character

<br>

## Task 2: Trim List {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given list of numbers, `@n` and an integer `$i`.

Write a script to trim the given list where element is `less than or equal to` the given integer.

#### Example 1

    Input: @n = (1,4,2,3,5) and $i = 3
    Output: (4,5)

#### Example 2

    Input: @n = (9,0,6,2,3,8,5) and $i = 4
    Output: (9,6,8,5)
