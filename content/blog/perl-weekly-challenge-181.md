## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}

Welcome to `Week #181` of the weekly challenge.

Welcome a new member, `Bejoy Mathews`, an experienced `Perl` hacker. Thanks for the first contributions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-180/bejoy-mathews/perl).

Today, we are giving away `Token #4` to `Kueppo Wesley` for the book, [**Learning Perl Exercises**](https://leanpub.com/learning_perl_exercises) by `brian d foy`. I will share the details with you in a separate email.

Another announcement of the week, since today is the first `Monday` of the month and time to declare the next champion, `Stephen G. Lynn`. He joined the `Team PWC` in the `Week #168`. Ever since he has contributed in both `Perl` and `Raku` without missing a week. He even shared blog post every week except the first two weeks.

Welcome back, `Tyler Wardhaugh`, after the break and thanks for introducing a new language, [**Fennel**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-180/tyler-wardhaugh/fennel) to the `Team PWC`. With this new addition, we now have `91 guest languages` other than `Perl` and `Raku`. It would be big deal when we get to the magic number of `100`.

`Laurent Rosenfeld` is back with maximum guest contributions, `23 solutions` in `14 languages`.

We had surprise element last week too as `Ali Moradi` contributed `14 solutions` in `7 languages` alongwith the regular contributions by `Roger Bell_West`.

I would also like to mention another member, `AhmetEmre`, for guest contributions. Last week, he shared solutions in `BQN` for the `Week 1-56` as well as current week. With this, he jumped to `rank #12` in the `Guest Leader` board.

I am back again after a short break and shared solutions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-180/mohammad-anwar/perl), [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-180/mohammad-anwar/raku), [**Python**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-180/mohammad-anwar/python), [**Java**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-180/mohammad-anwar/java/theweeklychallenge) and [**Swift**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-180/mohammad-anwar/swift) .

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2022. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Sentence Order {#TASK1}

You are given a paragraph.

Write a script to order each sentence alphanumerically and print the whole paragraph.

#### Example

    Input:
        All he could think about was how it would all end. There was
        still a bit of uncertainty in the equation, but the basics
        were there for anyone to see. No matter how much he tried to
        see the positive, it wasn't anywhere to be seen. The end was
        coming and it wasn't going to be pretty.
