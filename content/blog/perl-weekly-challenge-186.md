## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}

Welcome to the `Week #186` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Welcome back `Andinus` after the break. Thank you for contributions in [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-185/andinus/raku) and [**blog post**](https://andinus.unfla.me/pwc/challenge-185).

We are into the second week of `Hacktoberfest 2022`. I am not surprised the rise of popularity of `The Weekly Challenge`. Please find below the weekly contributions breakdown.

### Week #1
    Perl: 57 Raku: 31 Blog: 17

### Week #2
    Perl: 61 Raku: 35 Blog: 19

<br>

Last week, we had `40` regular contributors and `15` guest contributors. Thank you everyone for the support and encouragement.

Let us all welcome another guest contributor, [**Joao Felipe**](https://github.com/JoaoFelipe3), an experienced `APL` hacker.

Last week we decided to give away the `FREE` book token to `Kjetil Skotheim` but unfortunately we didn't have his contact details. I request `Kjetil` to share email address, so that the we can send the token.

Today, we are giving away `Token #9` to `Niels van Dijke` for the book, [**Learning Perl Exercises**](https://leanpub.com/learning_perl_exercises) by `brian d foy`. I will share the details with you in a separate email.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2022. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Zip List  {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given two list `@a` and `@b` of same size.

Create a subroutine `sub zip(@a, @b)` that merge the two list as shown in the example below.

#### Example

    Input:  @a = qw/1 2 3/; @b = qw/a b c/;
    Output: zip(@a, @b) should return qw/1 a 2 b 3 c/;
            zip(@b, @a) should return qw/a 1 b 2 c 3/;

<br>

## Task 2: Unicode Makeover {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a string with possible unicode characters.

Create a subroutine `sub makeover($str)` that replace the unicode characters with ascii equivalent. For this task, let us assume it only contains alphabets.

#### Example 1

    Input: $str = 'ÃÊÍÒÙ';
    Output: 'AEIOU'

#### Example 2

    Input: $str = 'âÊíÒÙ';
    Output: 'aEiOU'
