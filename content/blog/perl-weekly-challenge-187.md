## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2022. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Days Together {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

Two friends, `Foo` and `Bar` gone on holidays seperately to the same city. You are given their schedule i.e. `start date` and `end date`.

To keep the task simple, the date is in the form `DD-MM` and all dates belong to the same calendar year i.e. between `01-01` and `31-12`. Also the year is `non-leap year` and both dates are inclusive.

Write a script to find out for the given schedule, how many days they spent together in the city, if at all.

### Example 1

    Input: Foo => SD: '12-01' ED: '20-01'
           Bar => SD: '15-01' ED: '18-01'

    Output: 4 days

### Example 2

    Input: Foo => SD: '02-03' ED: '12-03'
           Bar => SD: '13-03' ED: '14-03'

    Output: 0 day

### Example 3

    Input: Foo => SD: '02-03' ED: '12-03'
           Bar => SD: '11-03' ED: '15-03'

    Output: 2 days

### Example 4

    Input: Foo => SD: '30-03' ED: '05-04'
           Bar => SD: '28-03' ED: '02-04'

    Output: 4 days

<br>

## Task 2: Magical Triplets {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a list of positive numbers, `@n`, having at least 3 numbers.

Write a script to find the triplets `(a, b, c)` from the given list that satisfies the following rules.

    1. a + b > c
    2. b + c > a
    3. a + c > b
    4. a + b + c is maximum.

In case, you end up with more than one triplets having the maximum then pick the triplet where `a >= b >= c`.

<br>

#### Example 1

        Input: @n = (1, 2, 3, 2);
        Output: (3, 2, 2)

#### Example 2

        Input: @n = (1, 3, 2);
        Output: ()

#### Example 3

        Input: @n = (1, 1, 2, 3);
        Output: ()

#### Example 4

        Input: @n = (2, 4, 3);
        Output: (4, 3, 2)
