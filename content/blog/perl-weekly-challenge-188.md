Welcome to the `Week #188` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

We are into the fourth week of `Hacktoberfest 2022`. At last, we made it, little late though to get the `100+` mark this time too.

<br>

    Week: #1  #2  #3  #4

Last week, we had `36` regular contributors and `13` guest contributors. Thank you everyone for the support and encouragement.

Today, we are giving away `Token #11` to `Duncan C. White` for the book, [**Learning Perl Exercises**](https://leanpub.com/learning_perl_exercises) by `brian d foy`. I will share the details with you in a separate email.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2022. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Divisible Pairs {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given list of integers `@list` of size `$n` and divisor `$k`.

Write a script to find out count of pairs in the given list that satisfies the following rules.

    The pair (i, j) is eligible if and only if
    a) 0 <= i < j < len(list)
    b) list[i] + list[j] is divisible by k

### Example 1

    Input: @list = (4, 5, 1, 6), $k = 2
    Output: 2

### Example 2

    Input: @list = (1, 2, 3, 4), $k = 2
    Output: 2

### Example 3

    Input: @list = (1, 3, 4, 5), $k = 3
    Output: 2

### Example 4

    Input: @list = (5, 1, 2, 3), $k = 4
    Output: 2

### Example 5

    Input: @list = (7, 2, 4, 5), $k = 4
    Output: 1

<br>

## Task 2: Total Zero {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given two positive integers `$x` and `$y`.

Write a script to find out the number of operations needed to make both `ZERO`.  Each operation is made up either of the followings:

    $x = $x - $y if $x >= $y

    or

    $y = $y - $x if $y >= $x (using the original value of $x)

#### Example 1

    Input: $x = 5, $y = 4
    Output: 5

#### Example 2

    Input: $x = 4, $y = 6
    Output: 3

#### Example 3

    Input: $x = 2, $y = 5
    Output: 4

#### Example 4

    Input: $x = 3, $y = 1
    Output: 3

#### Example 5

    Input: $x = 7, $y = 4
    Output: 5
