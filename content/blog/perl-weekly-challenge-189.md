Thanks `Vamsi` for your first contributions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-188/vamsi-meenavilli/perl) and [**Python**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-188/vamsi-meenavilli/python).

Thanks `Andrew` for your first contributions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-188/spazm/perl), [**Python**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-188/spazm/python) and [**Rust**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-188/spazm/rust).

We are into the last week of `Hacktoberfest 2022`. Well done `Team PWC` for making it big week after week.

I would like to thank every guest contributors for making it special this time as we received `84 contributions` in `26 languages`.

Thank you, `Ali Moradi`, for introducing new language [**Nelua**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-188/deadmarshal/nelua). As of today, we now have overall guest contributions in `92 languages` on top of main contributing languages, `Perl` and `Raku`.

Last week, I managed to contribute in `Perl`, `Raku`, `Python`, `Java` and `Swift` after a long time.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2022. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Greater Character {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of characters (a..z) and a target character.

Write a script to find out the smallest character in the given array lexicographically greater than the target character.

### Example 1

    Input: @array = qw/e m u g/, $target = 'b'
    Output: e

### Example 2

    Input: @array = qw/d c e f/, $target = 'a'
    Output: c

### Example 3

    Input: @array = qw/j a r/, $target = 'o'
    Output: r

### Example 4

    Input: @array = qw/d c a f/, $target = 'a'
    Output: c

### Example 5

    Input: @array = qw/t g a l/, $target = 'v'
    Output: v

<br>

## Task 2: Array Degree {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of 2 or more non-negative integers.

Write a script to find out the smallest slice, i.e. contiguous subarray of the original array, having the degree of the given array.

> The degree of an array is the maximum frequency of an element in the array.

#### Example 1

    Input: @array = (1, 3, 3, 2)
    Output: (3, 3)

    The degree of the given array is 2.
    The possible subarrays having the degree 2 are as below:
    (3, 3)
    (1, 3, 3)
    (3, 3, 2)
    (1, 3, 3, 2)

    And the smallest of all is (3, 3).

#### Example 2

    Input: @array = (1, 2, 1, 3)
    Output: (1, 2, 1)

#### Example 3

    Input: @array = (1, 3, 2, 1, 2)
    Output: (2, 1, 2)

#### Example 4

    Input: @array = (1, 1, 2, 3, 2)
    Output: (1, 1)

#### Example 5

    Input: @array = (2, 1, 2, 1, 1)
    Output: (1, 2, 1, 1)
