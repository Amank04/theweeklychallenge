## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2022. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Capital Detection {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a string with alphabetic characters only: `A..Z` and `a..z`.

Write a script to find out if the usage of Capital is appropriate if it satisfies at least one of the following rules:

    1) Only first letter is capital and all others are small.
    2) Every letter is small.
    3) Every letter is capital.

<br>

### Example 1

    Input: $s = 'Perl'
    Output: 1

### Example 2

    Input: $s = 'TPF'
    Output: 1

### Example 3

    Input: $s = 'PyThon'
    Output: 0

### Example 4

    Input: $s = 'raku'
    Output: 1

<br>

## Task 2: Decoded List {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an encoded string consisting of a sequence of numeric characters: 0..9, `$s`.

Write a script to find the all valid different decodings in sorted order.

> Encoding is simply done by mapping A,B,C,D,... to 1,2,3,4,... etc.

#### Example 1

    Input: $s = 11
    Output: AA, K

    11 can be decoded as (1 1) or (11) i.e. AA or K

#### Example 2

    Input: $s = 1115
    Output: AAAE, AAO, AKE, KAE, KO

    Possible decoded data are:
    (1 1 1 5) => (AAAE)
    (1 1 15)  => (AAO)
    (1 11 5)  => (AKE)
    (11 1 5)  => (KAE)
    (11 15)   => (KO)

#### Example 3

    Input: $s = 127
    Output: ABG, LG

    Possible decoded data are:
    (1 2 7) => (ABG)
    (12 7)  => (LG)
