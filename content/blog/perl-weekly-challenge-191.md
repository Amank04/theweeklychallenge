Welcome to the `Week #191` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Last week, I forgot to announce the champion as it was the first Monday of the month. Apology.

Today, we announce our next champion, `Feng Chang`, from Beijing, China. He joined the `Team PWC` long time ago, in the `Week 12`, to be precise. It took so long to nominate him as champion, sorry. He is currently `ranked #30` in the leader board with total `score 392`. As of today, he has contributed `23 Perl` and `173 Raku` solutions.

Another busy week with `100+` contributions. This is the record in the history of `The Weekly Challenge`, we achieved the target for the `7 consecutive weeks`. Thank you `Team PWC` for the support and encouragement.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2022. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Twice Largest {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given list of integers, `@list`.

Write a script to find out whether the largest item in the list is at least twice as large as each of the other items.

### Example 1

    Input: @list = (1,2,3,4)
    Output: -1

    The largest in the given list is 4. However 4 is not greater than twice of every remaining elements.
    1 x 2 <= 4
    2 x 2 <= 4
    2 x 3 >  4

### Example 2

    Input: @list = (1,2,0,5)
    Output: 1

    The largest in the given list is 5. Also 5 is greater than twice of every remaining elements.
    1 x 2 <= 5
    2 x 2 <= 5
    0 x 2 <= 5

### Example 3

    Input: @list = (2,6,3,1)
    Output: 1

    The largest in the given list is 6. Also 6 is greater than twice of every remaining elements.
    2 x 2 <= 6
    3 x 2 <= 6
    1 x 2 <= 6

### Example 4

    Input: @list = (4,5,2,3)
    Output: -1

    The largest in the given list is 5. Also 5 is not greater than twice of every remaining elements.
    4 x 2 >  5
    2 x 2 <= 5
    3 x 2 >  5

<br>

## Task 2: Cute List {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an integer, `0 < $n <= 15`.

Write a script to find the number of orderings of numbers that form a cute list.

With an input @list = (1, 2, 3, .. $n) for positive integer $n, an ordering of @list is cute if for every entry, indexed with a base of
1, either

    1) $list[$i] is evenly divisible by $i
    or
    2) $i is evenly divisible by $list[$i]

#### Example

    Input: $n = 2
    Ouput: 2

    Since $n = 2, the list can be made up of two integers only i.e. 1 and 2.
    Therefore we can have two list i.e. (1,2) and (2,1).

    @list = (1,2) is cute since $list[1] = 1 is divisible by 1 and $list[2] = 2 is divisible by 2.
