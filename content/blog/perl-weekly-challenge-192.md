I would like to thank every guest contributors for making it special every week. Last week we received `70 guest contributions` in `26 languages`.

Welcome back, `Daniel Pfeiffer` after the short break and thanks for sharing solutions for [**Task #1**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-191/daniel-pfeiffer/perl/ch-1.sh) and [**Task #2**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-191/daniel-pfeiffer/perl/ch-2.sh) with [**blog post**](https://perl1liner.sourceforge.io/Perl-Weekly-Challenge).

Thank you, `Jorg Sommrey`, for introducing new guest language `Maxima` and sharing solution to [**Task #2**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-191/jo-37/maxima/ch-2.wxm) using the language.

Last but not the least, I would also like to thank, `E. Alvarez` for the [**blog post**](https://alvar3z.com/posts/reduce--backtrack). Being a guest contributor, it doesn't get space in the [**Weekly Recaps**](/recaps) sections, so I decided to mention it here.

Last week, I could only find time to do just one task.

<br>

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2022. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Binary Flip {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a positive integer, `$n`.

Write a script to find the binary flip.

### Example 1

    Input: $n = 5
    Output: 2

    First find the binary equivalent of the given integer, 101.
    Then flip the binary digits 0 -> 1 and 1 -> 0 and we get 010.
    So Binary 010 => Decimal 2.

### Example 2

    Input: $n = 4
    Output: 3

    Decimal 4 = Binary 100
    Flip 0 -> 1 and 1 -> 0, we get 011.
    Binary 011 = Decimal 3

### Example 3

    Input: $n = 6
    Output: 1

    Decimal 6 = Binary 110
    Flip 0 -> 1 and 1 -> 0, we get 001.
    Binary 001 = Decimal 1

<br>

## Task 2: Equal Distribution {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a list of integers greater than or equal to zero, `@list`.

Write a script to distribute the number so that each members are same. If you succeed then print the total moves otherwise print `-1`.

Please follow the rules (as suggested by `Neils van Dijke` [2022-11-21 13:00]

    1) You can only move a value of '1' per move
    2) You are only allowed to move a value of '1' to a direct neighbor/adjacent cell

<br>

#### Example 1:

    Input: @list = (1, 0, 5)
    Output: 4

    Move #1: 1, 1, 4
    (2nd cell gets 1 from the 3rd cell)

    Move #2: 1, 2, 3
    (2nd cell gets 1 from the 3rd cell)

    Move #3: 2, 1, 3
    (1st cell get 1 from the 2nd cell)

    Move #4: 2, 2, 2
    (2nd cell gets 1 from the 3rd cell)

#### Example 2:

    Input: @list = (0, 2, 0)
    Output: -1

    It is not possible to make each same.


#### Example 3:

    Input: @list = (0, 3, 0)
    Output: 2

    Move #1: 1, 2, 0
    (1st cell gets 1 from the 2nd cell)

    Move #2: 1, 1, 1
    (3rd cell gets 1 from the 2nd cell)

Last date to submit the solution **23:59 (UK Time) Sunday 27th November 2022**.
