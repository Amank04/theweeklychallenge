Welcome to the `Week #193` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Life is always full of `ups & downs`. As the year ending, I look back and noticed I missed so many things. I wanted to do so much but couldn't get anywhere near. This year also we are going to do our own `Advent Calendar`. If you want your special blog post to be part of this year `Advent Calendar` then please do drop me a line. The general idea is I pick my favourite otherwise.

Another busy week with `100+` contributions. This is the record in the history of `The Weekly Challenge`, we achieved the target for the `9th consecutive weeks`. Thank you `Team PWC` for the support and encouragement.

Today, we are giving away `Coupon #16` to `Simon Green` for the book, [**Learning Perl Exercises**](https://leanpub.com/learning_perl_exercises) by `brian d foy`. I will share the details with you in a separate email.

I would like to thank every guest contributors for making it special every week. Last week we received `62 guest contributions` in `20 languages`.

Here again, please checkout the [**blog post**](https://alvar3z.com/posts/bytethematics-perl-weekly-challenge-192/) by `E. Alvarez`. Being a guest contributor, it doesn't get space in the [**Weekly Recaps**](/recaps) sections, so I decided to mention it here.

Last week, I could only find time to do just one task.

<br>

### Task #1: Binary Flip &nbsp; &nbsp; [[Perl](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-192/mohammad-anwar/perl/ch-1.pl)] [[Raku](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-192/mohammad-anwar/raku/ch-1.raku)] [[Python](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-192/mohammad-anwar/python/ch-1.py)] [[Java](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-192/mohammad-anwar/java/theweeklychallenge/BinaryFlip.java)] [[Swift](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-192/mohammad-anwar/swift/ch-1.swift)]

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2022. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Binary String {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an integer, `$n > 0`.

Write a script to find all possible binary numbers of size `$n`.

### Example 1

    Input: $n = 2
    Output: 00, 11, 01, 10

### Example 2

    Input: $n = 3
    Output: 000, 001, 010, 100, 111, 110, 101, 011

<br>

## Task 2: Odd String {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a list of strings of same length, `@s`.

Write a script to find the odd string in the given list. Use positional value of alphabet starting with `0`, i.e. `a = 0, b = 1, ... z = 25`.

> Find the difference array for each string as shown in the example. Then pick the odd one out.

#### Example 1:

    Input: @s = ("adc", "wzy", "abc")
    Output: "abc"

    Difference array for "adc" => [ d - a, c - d ]
                               => [ 3 - 0, 2 - 3 ]
                               => [ 3, -1 ]

    Difference array for "wzy" => [ z - w, y - z ]
                               => [ 25 - 22, 24 - 25 ]
                               => [ 3, -1 ]

    Difference array for "abc" => [ b - a, c - b ]
                               => [ 1 - 0, 2 - 1 ]
                               => [ 1, 1 ]

    The difference array for "abc" is the odd one.

#### Example 2:

    Input: @s = ("aaa", "bob", "ccc", "ddd")
    Output: "bob"

    Difference array for "aaa" => [ a - a, a - a ]
                               => [ 0 - 0, 0 - 0 ]
                               => [ 0, 0 ]

    Difference array for "bob" => [ o - b, b - o ]
                               => [ 14 - 1, 1 - 14 ]
                               => [ 13, -13 ]

    Difference array for "ccc" => [ c - c, c - c ]
                               => [ 2 - 2, 2 - 2 ]
                               => [ 0, 0 ]

    Difference array for "ddd" => [ d - d, d - d ]
                               => [ 3 - 3, 3 - 3 ]
                               => [ 0, 0 ]

    The difference array for "bob" is the odd one.
