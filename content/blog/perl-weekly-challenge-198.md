Welcome to the `Week #198` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

<br>

### Wish you all a very Happy New Year 2023

<br>

Today we are going to announce the last `Champion of the Year 2022` as today is the first `Monday` of the month.

So, with great pride we announce, `Ali Moradi`, as the `Champion of the Month`. He joined the `Team PWC` in the `Week 096`. As of today, he has contributed `43 Perl` and `23 Raku` solutions. He hasn't made to the `Top 50` in the `Leaders Board` yet. However he is currently `Ranked #8` in the `Guest Leaders Board`. He has been a prolific guest contributors and contributed in `12 languages` as well as `Perl` and `Raku`.

Last week of holiday ending now. Time to start new year with fresh energy. As of now, we couldn't reach the magic number. It is still possible to get there if there is any late submission. So far, we have received `95 contributions`. Thank you `Team PWC` for the support and encouragement.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2022. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Max Gap {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a list of integers, `@list`.

Write a script to find the total pairs in the sorted list where 2 consecutive elements has the max gap. If the list contains less then 2 elements then return 0.

<br>

### Example 1

    Input:  @list = (2,5,8,1)
    Output: 2

    Since the sorted list (1,2,5,8) has 2 such pairs (2,5) and (5,8)

### Example 2

    Input: @list = (3)
    Output: 0

<br>

## Task 2: Prime Count {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an integer `$n > 0`.

Write a script to print the count of primes less than `$n`.

### Example 1

    Input: $n = 10
    Output: 4 as in there are 4 primes less than 10 are 2, 3, 5 ,7.

### Example 2

    Input: $n = 15
    Output: 6

### Example 3

    Input: $n = 1
    Output: 0

### Example 4

    Input: $n = 25
    Output: 9
