## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}

Welcome to the `Week #201` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Last week, `Mariano Spadaccini`, joined the `Team PWC`. Thank you for your first contributions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-200/spadacciniweb/perl).

Apology for the late acceptance of your contributions last week. I wasn't mentally there, so avoided the screen as much as I can. I have had plenty of messages which I would reply individually soon. Your messages means a lot and I do read them all. I like `one-2-one` style conversation with the team members.

Some members offered helping hands, I would like to take this opportunity to than each one of them. For now, I am good but will definitely come back to you if I need any assistance.

Today, we are giving away `Coupon #24` to `Pip Stuart` for the book, [**Learning Perl Exercises**](https://leanpub.com/learning_perl_exercises) by `brian d foy`. I will share the details with you in a separate email.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2022. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Missing Numbers {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of unique numbers.

Write a script to find out all missing numbers in the range `0..$n` where `$n` is the array size.

<br>

### Example 1

    Input: @array = (0,1,3)
    Output: 2

    The array size i.e. total element count is 3, so the range is 0..3.
    The missing number is 2 in the given array.

### Example 2

    Input: @array = (0,1)
    Output: 2

    The array size is 2, therefore the range is 0..2.
    The missing number is 2.

<br>

## Task 2: Penny Piles {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Robbie Hatley](https://github.com/robbie-hatley)
***

You are given an integer, `$n > 0`.

Write a script to determine the number of ways of putting `$n pennies` in a row of piles of ascending heights from left to right.

### Example

    Input: $n = 5
    Output: 7

    Since $n=5, there are 7 ways of stacking 5 pennies in ascending piles:

        1 1 1 1 1
        1 1 1 2
        1 2 2
        1 1 3
        2 3
        1 4
        5
