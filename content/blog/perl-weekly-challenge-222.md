## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}

Welcome to the `Week #222` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Just a quick update about my dad, I lost him last **Monday**. May his soul `Rest in Peace`. Thank you everyone for the kind messages.

Let us all welcome `Andreas Voegele`, an expert `Perl` hacker from `Stuttgart, Germany` to the `Team PWC`.

Finally, it is time to announce the next champion, little late though. So we declare `Matthias Muth` as our **Champion** of the month `May 2023`. As of today, he has contributed `34 Perl` solutions and `14 blogs`.

Today, we are giving away `Coupon #45` to `Jan Krnavek` for the book, [**Learning Perl Exercises**](https://leanpub.com/learning_perl_exercises) by `brian d foy`. I will share the details with you in a separate email.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2023. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2023. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Matching Members {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a list of positive integers, @ints.

Write a script to find the total matching members after sorting the list increasing order.

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3)
    Output: 3

    Original list: (1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2)
    Sorted list  : (1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4)

    Compare the two lists, we found 3 matching members (1, 1, 2).

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (5, 1, 2, 3, 4)
    Output: 0

    Original list: (5, 1, 2, 3, 4)
    Sorted list  : (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

    Compare the two lists, we found 0 matching members.

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    Output: 5

    Original list: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    Sorted list  : (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

    Compare the two lists, we found 5 matching members.

<br>

## Task 2: Last Member {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of positive integers, @ints.

Write a script to find the last member if found otherwise return 0. Each turn pick 2 biggest members (x, y) then decide based on the following conditions, continue this until you are left with 1 member or none.

> a) if x == y then remove both members

> b) if x != y then remove both members and add new member (y-x)

<br>

#### Example 1:

    Input: @ints = (2, 7, 4, 1, 8, 1)
    Output: 1

    Step 1: pick 7 and 8, we remove both and add new member 1 => (2, 4, 1, 1, 1).
    Step 2: pick 2 and 4, we remove both and add new member 2 => (2, 1, 1, 1).
    Step 3: pick 2 and 1, we remove both and add new member 1 => (1, 1, 1).
    Step 4: pick 1 and 1, we remove both => (1).

#### Example 2:

    Input: @ints = (1)
    Output: 1

#### Example 3:

    Input: @ints = (1, 1)
    Output: 0

    Step 1: pick 1 and 1, we remove both and we left with none.
