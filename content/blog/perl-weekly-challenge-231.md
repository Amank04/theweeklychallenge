## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #231` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Let us all welcome new member, [**rcmlz**](https://github.com/rcmlz), to the `Team PWC`.

This week challenge is the struggle work from place where I hardly had stable internet. Somehow I am managing it.

I can't wait to get to back to my regular comfortable place i.e. London.

Last `5 weeks` mainstream contribution stats. Thank you `Team PWC`  for your support and encouragements.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2023. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2023. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Min Max {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of distinct integers.

Write a script to find all elements that is neither minimum nor maximum. Return -1 if you can't.

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (3, 2, 1, 4)
    Output: (3, 2)

    The minimum is 1 and maximum is 4 in the given array. So (3, 2) is neither min nor max.

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (3, 1)
    Output: -1

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (2, 1, 3)
    Output: (2)

    The minimum is 1 and maximum is 3 in the given array. So 2 is neither min nor max.

<br>

## Task 2: Senior Citizens {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a list of passenger details in the form "9999999999A1122", where 9 denotes the phone number, A the sex, 1 the age and 2 the seat number.

Write a script to return the count of all senior citizens (age >= 60).

#### Example 1

    Input: @list = ("7868190130M7522","5303914400F9211","9273338290F4010")
    Ouput: 2

    The age of the passengers in the given list are 75, 92 and 40.
    So we have only 2 senior citizens.

#### Example 2

    Input: @list = ("1313579440F2036","2921522980M5644")
    Ouput: 0
