## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #233` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Let us all welcome two new members, `Clifton Wood` and `Macy TY` to the `Team PWC`.

Today is the first `Monday` of the month and we have a new champion, `BarrOff`. He joined the `Team PWC` in the `Week #204`. As of today, he has contributed `22 Perl`, `47 Raku` and `2 blogs`.

You must be wondering where is the `Week #232` challenge?

Well, it is entirely my fault that you all missed the fun last week.

It was a very terrible week for me as I landed back home from `India` with lots of viruses. Initially I suspected `COVID` but it turned out to be false alarm, thank `GOD`. Whatever it was, it brought me down completely and made me bedridden all week. Even while I am typing this, I am not fully recovered but I couldn't let another week go without action.

I would like to thank everyone for asking me about my health and offered help. You have been a great support throughout the journey of this weekly challenge. A lots of new members coming up with interesting ideas and sharing with me. So thank you for all the ideas. Please excuse me if I don't act straight away. Let me get back to my legs fully first.

I noticed, `Week #231` became the second most active week in the history of weekly challenge with total `137 contributions` and `83 guest contributions`. Thank you `Team PWC` for the contributions.

Last `5 weeks` mainstream contribution stats. Thank you `Team PWC`  for your support and encouragements.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2023. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2023. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Similar Words {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of words made up of alphabets only.

Write a script to find the number of pairs of similar words. Two words are similar if they consist of the same characters.

#### Example 1

    Input: @words = ("aba", "aabb", "abcd", "bac", "aabc")
    Output: 2

    Pair 1: similar words ("aba", "aabb")
    Pair 2: similar words ("bac", "aabc")

#### Example 2

    Input: @words = ("aabb", "ab", "ba")
    Output: 3

    Pair 1: similar words ("aabb", "ab")
    Pair 2: similar words ("aabb", "ba")
    Pair 3: similar words ("ab", "ba")

#### Example 3

    Input: @words = ("nba", "cba", "dba")
    Output: 0

<br>

## Task 2: Frequency Sort {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers.

Write a script to sort the given array in increasing order based on the frequency of the values. If multiple values have the same frequency then sort them in decreasing order.

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (1,1,2,2,2,3)
    Ouput: (3,1,1,2,2,2)

    '3' has a frequency of 1
    '1' has a frequency of 2
    '2' has a frequency of 3

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (2,3,1,3,2)
    Ouput: (1,3,3,2,2)

    '2' and '3' both have a frequency of 2, so they are sorted in decreasing order.

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (-1,1,-6,4,5,-6,1,4,1)
    Ouput: (5,-1,4,4,-6,-6,1,1,1)
