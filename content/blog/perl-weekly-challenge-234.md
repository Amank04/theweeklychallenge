## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2023. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2023. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Common Characters {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of words made up of alphabetic characters only.

Write a script to return all alphabetic characters that show up in all words including duplicates.

#### Example 1

    Input: @words = ("java", "javascript", "julia")
    Output: ("j", "a")

#### Example 2

    Input: @words = ("bella", "label", "roller")
    Output: ("e", "l", "l")

#### Example 3

    Input: @words = ("cool", "lock", "cook")
    Output: ("c", "o")

<br>

## Task 2: Unequal Triplets {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of positive integers.

Write a script to find the number of triplets (i, j, k) that satisfies num[i] != num[j], num[j] != num[k] and num[k] != num[i].

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (4, 4, 2, 4, 3)
    Ouput: 3

    (0, 2, 4) because 4 != 2 != 3
    (1, 2, 4) because 4 != 2 != 3
    (2, 3, 4) because 2 != 4 != 3

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
    Ouput: 0

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (4, 7, 1, 10, 7, 4, 1, 1)
    Output: 28

    triplets of 1, 4, 7  = 3x2×2 = 12 combinations
    triplets of 1, 4, 10 = 3×2×1 = 6  combinations
    triplets of 4, 7, 10 = 2×2×1 = 4  combinations
    triplets of 1, 7, 10 = 3x2x1 = 6 combinations
