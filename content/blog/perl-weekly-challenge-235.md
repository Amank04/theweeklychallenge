## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2023. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2023. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Remove One {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers.

Write a script to find out if removing ONLY one integer makes it strictly increasing order.

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (0, 2, 9, 4, 6)
    Output: true

    Removing ONLY 9 in the given array makes it strictly increasing order.

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (5, 1, 3, 2)
    Output: false

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (2, 2, 3)
    Output: true

<br>

## Task 2: Duplicate Zeros {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers.

Write a script to duplicate each occurrence of ZERO in the given array and shift the remaining to the right but make sure the size of array remain the same.

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (1, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 5, 0)
    Ouput: (1, 0, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 4)

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (1, 2, 3)
    Ouput: (1, 2, 3)

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (0, 3, 0, 4, 5)
    Ouput: (0, 0, 3, 0, 0)
