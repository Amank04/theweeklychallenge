## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #237` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

I finally managed to get the [**interview**](/blog/meet-the-champion-2023-07) done with the champion, `Mariano Spadaccini`. A polite reminder to all champions who haven't responded the interview request. Please do share your story with us when you get time. Please do let me know if you didn't get the invitation from me.

Today is the first `Monday` of the month and time to declare the next champion. I am happy to announce `Robbie Hatley` as our next champion. He joined the `Team PWC` in the `Week #098`. As of today, he has contributed `98 Perl` solutions and `37 blogs`.

`Flavio Poletti`, our elite member, surprised me by his comeback and shared his contributions to the [**Week #229**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-229/polettix).

For some strange reasons, I didn't get the contributions by `Arne Sommer` and `Packy Anderson`. So I did little walk around and pulled the contributions manually. I hope it is ethically acceptable.

In the past, we have received contributions from team members while they are on holiday. One even contributed from the hospital bed and her name was `Joelle Maslak`. So keeping the tradition alive, `Jorg Sommrey` has been contributing from his vacation.

`Ulrich Rieke` is one of the few who always encourage us with kind words and his bouquet of different languages week after week.

As you all know, `Laurent Rosenfeld`, holding the `Rank #1` with the total score `2352`. He has been with us since the beginning. What a consistent contributors he is.

I would also like to thank `Mark Anderson` for helping with the suggested tasks. It is a big help as finding new task every week is a big job. Thanks to the `Early Bird Club` members for helping with task review. Your contributions are priceless.

Just to let all members know, your weekly contributions as pull request can be part of the `Hacktoberfest` challenge. So if you haven't signed up yet then please do so soon. We are officially part of the `Hacktoberfest` this year too.

Last `5 weeks` mainstream contribution stats. Thank you `Team PWC`  for your support and encouragements.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2023. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2023. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Seize The Day {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mark Anderson](https://github.com/andemark)
***

Given a year, a month, a weekday of month, and a day of week (1 (Mon) .. 7 (Sun)), print the day.

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: Year = 2024, Month = 4, Weekday of month = 3, day of week = 2
    Output: 16

    The 3rd Tue of Apr 2024 is the 16th

#### Example 2

    Input: Year = 2025, Month = 10, Weekday of month = 2, day of week = 4
    Output: 9

    The 2nd Thu of Oct 2025 is the 9th

#### Example 3

    Input: Year = 2026, Month = 8, Weekday of month = 5, day of week = 3
    Output: 0

    There isn't a 5th Wed in Aug 2026

<br>

## Task 2: Maximise Greatness {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers.

Write a script to permute the give array such that you get the maximum possible greatness.

<br>

> To determine greatness, nums[i] < perm[i] where 0 <= i < nums.length

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: @nums = (1, 3, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1)
    Output: 4

    One possible permutation: (2, 5, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1) which returns 4 greatness as below:
    nums[0] < perm[0]
    nums[1] < perm[1]
    nums[3] < perm[3]
    nums[4] < perm[4]

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (1, 2, 3, 4)
    Output: 3

    One possible permutation: (2, 3, 4, 1) which returns 3 greatness as below:
    nums[0] < perm[0]
    nums[1] < perm[1]
    nums[2] < perm[2]
