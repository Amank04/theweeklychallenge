## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #238` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

A member of `Team PWC` raised an issue that I want to share with others with regard to the `Task #1` of `Week #235`.

> It turns out most of the linear solutions to that challenge are broken. Many of them do not handle [1,2,3,1,2,3] properly.

What a shame we don't have resource to review `Perl` solutions. I must admit, I haven't looked up the contributions closely to validate the issue raised. It would be great if we get to the bottom of the issue.

Last `5 weeks` mainstream contribution stats. Thank you `Team PWC`  for your support and encouragements.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2023. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2023. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Running Sum {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers.

Write a script to return the running sum of the given array. The running sum can be calculated as sum[i] = num[0] + num[1] + .... + num[i].

#### Example 1

    Input: @int = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    Output: (1, 3, 6, 10, 15)

#### Example 2

    Input: @int = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
    Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

#### Example 3

    Input: @int = (0, -1, 1, 2)
    Output: (0, -1, 0, 2)

<br>

## Task 2: Persistence Sort {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of positive integers.

Write a script to sort the given array in increasing order with respect to the count of steps required to obtain a single-digit number by multiplying its digits recursively for each array element. If any two numbers have the same count of steps, then print the smaller number first.

#### Example 1

    Input: @int = (15, 99, 1, 34)
    Output: (1, 15, 34, 99)

    15 => 1 x 5 => 5 (1 step)
    99 => 9 x 9 => 81 => 8 x 1 => 8 (2 steps)
    1  => 0 step
    34 => 3 x 4 => 12 => 1 x 2 => 2 (2 steps)

#### Example 2

    Input: @int = (50, 25, 33, 22)
    Output: (22, 33, 50, 25)

    50 => 5 x 0 => 0 (1 step)
    25 => 2 x 5 => 10 => 1 x 0 => 0 (2 steps)
    33 => 3 x 3 => 9 (1 step)
    22 => 2 x 2 => 4 (1 step)
