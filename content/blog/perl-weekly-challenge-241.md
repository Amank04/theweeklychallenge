## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #241` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Last week, I shared a report by `rcmlz` about `Raku Benchmark Scabality`. It created buzz among `Team PWC` members. It is always nice to hear positive response. Unfortunately I didn't get the report for the `Week #240`.

Last `5 weeks` mainstream contribution stats. Thank you `Team PWC`  for your support and encouragements.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2023. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2023. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Arithmetic Triplets {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array (3 or more members) of integers in increasing order and a positive integer.

Write a script to find out the number of unique `Arithmetic Triplets` satisfying the following rules:

    a) i < j < k
    b) nums[j] - nums[i] == diff
    c) nums[k] - nums[j] == diff

#### Example 1

    Input: @nums = (0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 10)
           $diff = 3
    Output: 2

    Index (1, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both  7 - 4 == 3 and 4 - 1 == 3.
    Index (2, 4, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 10 - 7 == 3 and 7 - 4 == 3.

#### Example 2

    Input: @nums = (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
           $diff = 2
    Output: 2

    (0, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 8 - 6 == 2 and 6 - 4 == 2.
    (1, 3, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 9 - 7 == 2 and 7 - 5 == 2.

<br>

## Task 2: Prime Order {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of unique positive integers greater than 2.

Write a script to sort them in ascending order of the count of their prime factors, tie-breaking by ascending value.

#### Example 1

    Input: @int = (11, 8, 27, 4)
    Output: (11, 4, 8, 27))

    Prime factors of 11 => 11
    Prime factors of  4 => 2, 2
    Prime factors of  8 => 2, 2, 2
    Prime factors of 27 => 3, 3, 3
