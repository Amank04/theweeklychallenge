Welcome to the `Week #242` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Once again, it is time to declare the next champion as today is the first monday of the month. With great pleasure, I announce `Packy Anderson` as the next champion of the weekly challenge. He joined the `Team PWC` in the `Week #227`. As of today he contributed `30 Perl`, `30 Raku`, `18 Python`, `8 Java` and `15 blogs`.

As you all know, we run our own [**Advent Calendar**](/blog/advent-calendar-2022/) every year. We will continue the tradition this year too. If you want your favourite blog post to be part of this year calendar then please do share the link with us (`perlweeklychallenge@yahoo.com`).

Last `5 weeks` mainstream contribution stats. Thank you `Team PWC`  for your support and encouragements.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2023. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2023. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Missing Members {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given two arrays of integers.

Write a script to find out the missing members in each other arrays.

#### Example 1

    Input: @arr1 = (1, 2, 3)
           @arr2 = (2, 4, 6)
    Output: ([1, 3], [4, 6])

    (1, 2, 3) has 2 members (1, 3) missing in the array (2, 4, 6).
    (2, 4, 6) has 2 members (4, 6) missing in the array (1, 2, 3).

#### Example 2

    Input: @arr1 = (1, 2, 3, 3)
           @arr2 = (1, 1, 2, 2)
    Output: ([3])

    (1, 2, 3, 3) has 2 members (3, 3) missing in the array (1, 1, 2, 2). Since they are same, keep just one.
    (1, 1, 2, 2) has 0 member missing in the array (1, 2, 3, 3).

<br>

## Task 2: Flip Matrix {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given `n x n` binary matrix.

Write a script to flip the given matrix as below.

<br>

    1 1 0
    0 1 1
    0 0 1

    a) Reverse each row

    0 1 1
    1 1 0
    1 0 0

    b) Invert each member

    1 0 0
    0 0 1
    0 1 1

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: @matrix = ([1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0])
    Output: ([1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1])

#### Example 2

    Input: @matrix = ([1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 0])
    Output: ([1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1, 0])
