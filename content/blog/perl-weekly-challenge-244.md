## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2023. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2023. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Count Smaller {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers.

Write a script to calculate the number of integers smaller than the integer at each index.

#### Example 1

    Input: @int = (8, 1, 2, 2, 3)
    Output: (4, 0, 1, 1, 3)

    For index = 0, count of elements less 8 is 4.
    For index = 1, count of elements less 1 is 0.
    For index = 2, count of elements less 2 is 1.
    For index = 3, count of elements less 2 is 1.
    For index = 4, count of elements less 3 is 3.

#### Example 2

    Input: @int = (6, 5, 4, 8)
    Output: (2, 1, 0, 3)

#### Example 3

    Input: @int = (2, 2, 2)
    Output: (0, 0, 0)

<br>

## Task 2: Group Hero {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers representing the strength.

Write a script to return the sum of the powers of all possible combinations; power is defined as the square of the largest number in a sequence, multiplied by the smallest.

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: @nums = (2, 1, 4)
    Output: 141

    Group 1: (2) => square(max(2)) * min(2) => 4 * 2 => 8
    Group 2: (1) => square(max(1)) * min(1) => 1 * 1 => 1
    Group 3: (4) => square(max(4)) * min(4) => 16 * 4 => 64
    Group 4: (2,1) => square(max(2,1)) * min(2,1) => 4 * 1 => 4
    Group 5: (2,4) => square(max(2,4)) * min(2,4) => 16 * 2 => 32
    Group 6: (1,4) => square(max(1,4)) * min(1,4) => 16 * 1 => 16
    Group 7: (2,1,4) => square(max(2,1,4)) * min(2,1,4) => 16 * 1 => 16

    Sum: 8 + 1 + 64 + 4 + 32 + 16 + 16 => 141
