## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #245` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

I am sure you all have noticed the popularity of `Python` among the team members. It is the top most loved programming language after `Perl` and `Raku`. Today we crossed `2000` mark i.e. we have received over `2000` contributions in `Python`. Thanks to all contributors.

We have a new member, `Oliver Oviedo`, joining the `Team PWC`. Welcome on board, `Oliver`, we are looking forward to your creative contributions.

Our latest champion, [**Pack Anderson**](/blog/meet-the-champion-2023-10), shared very special [**blog post**](https://packy.dardan.com/2023/11/21/perl-weekly-challenge-bonus-script). In the post, he shared his idea similar to `EZPWC` by fellow team member `Saif Ahmed`. Please do share your views with us.

We are almost there to welcome new `Advent Calendar 2023`. If you want to be part of it then please do share your blog post with us.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2023. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2023. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Sort Language {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given two array of languages and its popularity.

Write a script to sort the language based on popularity.

#### Example 1

    Input: @lang = ('perl', 'c', 'python')
           @popularity = (2, 1, 3)
    Output: ('c', 'perl', 'python')

#### Example 2

    Input: @lang = ('c++', 'haskell', 'java')
           @popularity = (1, 3, 2)
    Output: ('c++', 'java', 'haskell')

<br>

## Task 2: Largest of Three {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers >= 0.

Write a script to return the largest number formed by concatenating some of the given integers in any order which is also multiple of 3. Return -1 if none found.

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: @digits = (8, 1, 9)
    Output: 981

    981 % 3 == 0

#### Example 2

    Input: @digits = (8, 6, 7, 1, 0)
    Output: 8760

#### Example 3

    Input: @digits = (1)
    Output: -1
