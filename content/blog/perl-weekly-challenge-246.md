## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2023. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2023. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: 6 out of 49 {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Andreas Voegele](https://github.com/voegelas)
***

6 out of 49 is a German lottery.

Write a script that outputs six unique random integers from the range 1 to 49.

#### Output

    3
    10
    11
    22
    38
    49

<br>

## Task 2: Linear Recurrence of Second Order {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Jorg Sommrey](https://github.com/jo-37)
***

You are given an array `@a` of five integers.

Write a script to decide whether the given integers form a linear recurrence of second order with integer factors.

A **linear recurrence of second order** has the form

    a[n] = p * a[n-2] + q * a[n-1] with n > 1

    where p and q must be integers.

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: @a = (1, 1, 2, 3, 5)
    Output: true

    @a is the initial part of the Fibonacci sequence a[n] = a[n-2] + a[n-1]
    with a[0] = 1 and a[1] = 1.

#### Example 2

    Input: @a = (4, 2, 4, 5, 7)
    Output: false

    a[1] and a[2] are even. Any linear combination of two even numbers with integer factors is even, too.
    Because a[3] is odd, the given numbers cannot form a linear recurrence of second order with integer factors.

#### Example 3

    Input: @a = (4, 1, 2, -3, 8)
    Output: true

    a[n] = a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-1]
