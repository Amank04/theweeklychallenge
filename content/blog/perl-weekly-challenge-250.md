## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #250` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

`Happy New Year 2024` everyone. I hope it brings all the happiness in your life.

We all reached another milestone, i.e. entered the `Week #250` of the weekly challenge. It feels so unreal.

What a great way to start the new year with the announcement of next champion. The last champion of the year 2023 is `Kjetil Skotheim`. As of today he has contributed `58 Perl` solutions.

Last evening, `31st Dec`, we had surprise thunderstorm in our locality. And for fun, it just burnt my broadband router. I ended up with no internet. Imagine, the panicky moment. I had so much to process the weekly challenge contributions. And on top, the kids at home wants internet back asap. I called the broadband provider, knowing 31st evening nobody would pick my phone. Surprise surprise, I got through support team. I was told, it has happened to few others too and I am not alone. I am now told to wait for the replacement to arrive in 3 working days. Life without internet is un-imaginable these days. I am somehow managing this week challenge.

By the way, the sole sponsor of monthly prize, `Perl Careers`, is no longer continuing in the year 2024 unfortunately. I would like to personally thank the team of `Perl Careers` for supporting us for so long.

Right now, I am in discussion with two people for sponsorship. It is still early days. I am not sure how long it would take to finalise. I will keep you posted.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2023. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2023. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## Task 1: Smallest Index {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers, `@ints`.

Write a script to find the smallest index `i` such that `i mod 10 == $ints[i]` otherwise return -1.

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (0, 1, 2)
    Output: 0

    i=0: 0 mod 10 = 0 == $ints[0].
    i=1: 1 mod 10 = 1 == $ints[1].
    i=2: 2 mod 10 = 2 == $ints[2].
    All indices have i mod 10 == $ints[i], so we return the smallest index 0.

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (4, 3, 2, 1)
    Output: 2

    i=0: 0 mod 10 = 0 != $ints[0].
    i=1: 1 mod 10 = 1 != $ints[1].
    i=2: 2 mod 10 = 2 == $ints[2].
    i=3: 3 mod 10 = 3 != $ints[3].
    2 is the only index which has i mod 10 == $ints[i].

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0)
    Output: -1
    Explanation: No index satisfies i mod 10 == $ints[i].

<br>

## Task 2: Alphanumeric String Value {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of alphanumeric strings.

Write a script to return the maximum value of alphanumeric string in the given array.

The value of alphanumeric string can be defined as

    a) The numeric representation of the string in base 10 if it is made up of digits only.
    b) otherwise the length of the string

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: @alphanumstr = ("perl", "2", "000", "python", "r4ku")
    Output: 6

    "perl" consists of letters only so the value is 4.
    "2" is digits only so the value is 2.
    "000" is digits only so the value is 0.
    "python" consits of letters so the value is 6.
    "r4ku" consists of letters and digits so the value is 4.

#### Example 2

    Input: @alphanumstr = ("001", "1", "000", "0001")
    Output: 1
