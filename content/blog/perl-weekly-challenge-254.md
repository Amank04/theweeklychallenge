## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}

Welcome to the `Week #254` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Let us all welcome, `Alex Wilson` from `London` to the `Team PWC`. In the first week itself, he shared solutions in [**Uiua**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-253/probablyfine/uiua).

`Arne Sommer`, master of `Raku` programming language mostly but occasionaly also shares solutions in `Perl`. I am a big fan of his blog title. Last night, I was going through the blog post for the [**Perl Weekly**](https://perlweekly.com) newsletter, I noticed his blog post was not accessible. It never happened before. I am hoping it would be back soon.

Talking about blog post, another member of `Team PWC` and a regular contributor, `Roger Bell_West` came up with title `You Are the Weakest String`. It reminded me a TV show with similar title, [**The Weakest Link**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weakest_Link_(British_game_show)). It brought smile on my face. Thank you for keeping us all entertained.

We all know the history of `Raku` programming language. I remember early days, we used `.p6` extension for script then it was recommended to use `.raku` instead later. I noticed some of the `Raku` contributors in the `Team PWC` still using the old extension `.p6`. Nothing wrong in using old extension, just wanted to talk about it. We are ok with either, we have no issues at all.

Some of you, from the early days, would remember when the weekly challenge was called `Perl Weekly Challenge`. Then it changed to `The Weekly Challenge` to accomodate the sister language `Raku`. I noticed some member, still calls it `Perl Weekly Challenge`. It brings back the memory of early days. Keep using it for as long as you want. By the way, the team is still called, `Team PWC` and I am going to keep it like this forever.

`Dave Jacoby` blog post is also worth checking where he would share the story of week number. Like in [**last week post**](https://jacoby.github.io/2024/01/22/split-string-soup-weekly-challenge-253.html), he mentioned that `253` is the product of two primes, `11` and `23`, and thus itâ€™s a semiprime number. It is a Triangle Number also. Too much fun, thank you.

Another member, `Packy Anderson` comes up musical connection every week in his blog post. In his [**last blog post**](https://packy.dardan.com/2024/01/22/perl-weekly-challenge-3), he shared musical inspiration. I only listen to `Bollywood Music`, so I find it amusing. I learn a lot just reading the blog post.

I would like to thank every member of `Team PWC` for the support and encouragement. Some of you even take the time to write kind words to me every week. Thank you for the messages. Trust me, it gives me energy when I feel low. Please accept my apolog for not reply to your email. I am always running short of time, sorry.
