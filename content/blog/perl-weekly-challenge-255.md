## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}

Welcome to the `Week #255` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Let us all welcome, [**Archar Gelod**](https://github.com/Archargelod) to `Team PWC`. He shared his first contributions in [**Nim**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-254/archargelod/nim).

Recently joined guest contributor, `Alex Wilson`, shared his first [**blog post**](https://blog.probablyfine.co.uk/2024/01/31/solving-weekly-challenge-254-with-uiua.html) where he discussed his solutions in `Uiua`.

Today is the first `Monday` of the month and time to declare our next champion. With pleasure, I announce `Nelo Tovar` as the next champion of `The Weekly Challenge`. Congratulation `Nelo`.

I forgot to share a suggestion by a very respected member of `Perl` community. He suggested a fun challenge, [**Prisoner's dilemma**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma). If you want to play the game then you share your `prisoner` script written in `Perl`. Once I have all the contributions then I can test them to see which out of all the prisoners wins. I am looking forward to your participations.

## Task 1: Odd Character {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given two strings, `$s` and `$t`. The string `$t` is generated using the shuffled characters of the string `$s` with an additional character.

Write a script to find the additional character in the string `$t`..

#### Example 1

    Input: $s = "Perl" $t = "Preel"
    Output: "e"

#### Example 2

    Input: $s = "Weekly" $t = "Weeakly"
    Output: "a"

#### Example 3

    Input: $s = "Box" $t = "Boxy"
    Output: "y"

<br>

## Task 2: Most Frequent Word {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given a paragraph `$p` and a banned word `$w`.

Write a script to return the most frequent word that is not banned.

#### Example 1

    Input: $p = "Joe hit a ball, the hit ball flew far after it was hit."
           $w = "hit"
    Output: "ball"

    The banned word "hit" occurs 3 times.
    The other word "ball" occurs 2 times.

#### Example 2

    Input: $p = "Perl and Raku belong to the same family. Perl is the most popular language in the weekly challenge."
           $w = "the"
    Output: "Perl"

    The banned word "the" occurs 3 times.
    The other word "Perl" occurs 2 times.
