## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #258` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Let us all welcome `Ruth Holloway` who joined the `Team PWC` as a guest contributor to start with. She has contributed solutions in [**COBOL**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-257/geekruthie/cobol). It is always nice to see someone picked a language not many bothered to try. We should all take this opportunity to learn something new.

<br>

> I'm "GeekRuthie," aka Ruth Holloway, a 20-year veteran Perl coder and member of the Board of TPRF, and a member of the Dancer core team. I live in the southeastern US, and will be doing the challenges primarily in languages other than Perl or Raku, just for fun.

## Task 1: Count Even Digits Number {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given a array of positive integers, `@ints`.

Write a script to find out how many integers have even number of digits.

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (10, 1, 111, 24, 1000)
    Output: 3

    There are 3 integers having even digits i.e. 10, 24 and 1000.

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (111, 1, 11111)
    Output: 0

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (2, 8, 1024, 256)
    Output: 1

<br>

## Task 2: Sum of Values {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers, `@int` and an integer `$k`.

Write a script to find the sum of values whose index binary representation has exactly `$k` number of `1-bit` set.

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (2, 5, 9, 11, 3), $k = 1
    Output: 17

    Binary representation of index 0 = 0
    Binary representation of index 1 = 1
    Binary representation of index 2 = 10
    Binary representation of index 3 = 11
    Binary representation of index 4 = 100

    So the indices 1, 2 and 4 have total one 1-bit sets.
    Therefore the sum, $ints[1] + $ints[2] + $ints[3] = 17

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (2, 5, 9, 11, 3), $k = 2
    Output: 11

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (2, 5, 9, 11, 3), $k = 0
    Output: 2
