## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #259` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

This week tasks are proposed by `Lee Johnson` and `Gabor Szabo`. It is an honour for me that we get so much support from the `Perl` community. Today is the first `Monday` of the month and time to declare the next champion. With great pride, I announce `Mustafa Aydin` as our next champion. I know I haven't done the interview with the last champion, `Nelo Tovar`, sorry. I will get both done together soon.

I am not sure, if you noticed, `Ryan Thompson` is back in action. It is always pleasure to have him back. He has been a big supporter of the weekly challenge. I am hoping to see him regular now.

## Task 1: Banking Day Offset {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Lee Johnson](https://github.com/leejo)
***

You are given a start date and offset counter. Optionally you also get bank holiday date list.

Given a number (of days) and a start date, return the number (of days) adjusted to take into account non-banking days. In other words: convert a banking day offset to a calendar day offset.

Non-banking days are:

    a) Weekends
    b) Bank holidays

#### Example 1

    Input: $start_date = '2018-06-28', $offset = 3, $bank_holidays = ['2018-07-03']
    Output: '2018-07-04'

    Thursday bumped to Wednesday (3 day offset, with Monday a bank holiday)

#### Example 2

    Input: $start_date = '2018-06-28', $offset = 3
    Output: '2018-07-03'

<br>

## Task 2: Line Parser {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Gabor Szabo](https://github.com/szabgab)
***
You are given a line like below:

<br>

    {%  id   field1="value1"    field2="value2"  field3=42 %}

<br>

Where

    a) "id" can be \w+.
    b) There can be 0  or more field-value pairs.
    c) The name of the fields are \w+.
    b) The values are either number in which case we don't need double quotes or string in
       which case we need double quotes around them.

<br>

The line parser should return structure like below:

<br>

    {
           name => id,
           fields => {
               field1 => value1,
               field2 => value2,
               field3 => value3,
           }
    }

<br>

It should be able to parse the following edge cases too:

<br>

    {%  youtube title="Title \"quoted\" done" %}

<br>

**and**

<br>

    {%  youtube title="Title with escaped backslash \\" %}

<br>

**BONUS**: Extend it to be able to handle multiline tags:

<br>

    {% id  filed1="value1" ... %}
    LINES
    {% endid %}

<br>

You should expect the following structure from your line parser:

<br>

    {
           name => id,
           fields => {
               field1 => value1,
               field2 => value2,
               field3 => value3,
           }
           text => LINES
    }

<br>
