It has been wonderful journey so far in the year **2019**. When I started the journey in **March**, I didn't know it would take this shape. All credit goes to the support of **Perl/Raku** community in general. It would be unfair if I pick few names. You know who I am talking about anyway. Let me share the story with you all.

I was working on 2 ideas at the start of the year 2019, **"Perl Weekly Challenge"** and **"London Hack Day"**. As this was my first community project, I was completely unaware of how to do time management. I started with registering the domains for both project (**perlweeklychallenge.org** and **londonhackday.org**). Followed by creating dedicated email (**perlweeklychallenge@yahoo.com/londonhackday@yahoo.com**) and Twitter account (**@PerlWChallenge/@LondonHackDay**).

Then it was time to create the content for the website. I am not front-end guy technically but knows enough to get the work done. I was introduced to **"Hugo"** while I was writing an article for **perl.com**. I liked it for **2** reasons, one easy to setup and second easy to create article using **Markdown**. Then the mission was to find a theme supporting **Bootstrap**. I found one **"timer-hugo"** that looked elegant yet simple to work on.

Now time to host the static site, **GitHub Pages**, fits the bill perfectly. The best part of it, you get https for **FREE** as well. With lots of late nights and weekend, I finally had the website up and running. The launch of first weekly challenge was the most memorable one. There was so much support on **Twitter** and in general. I was overwhelmed. As we grew, I made some changes in the format to make it interesting.

On **3rd June 2019**, I received an email from **Pete Sergeant**, well respected **Perl Hacker** and **Recruiter**, offering to sponsor the **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**. It was the same day, we were celebrating the festival of **Idd**. So to me it was pleasnt **Idd Gift**. After setting up the formalities, we made it public and announced the first winner **"Laurent Rosenfeld"** in the **Week #13**. Ever since he has been sponsoring the weekly winner. A big **THANK YOU** to **Pete** for the support and encouragement.

While working on **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**, my other pet project **"London Hack Day"** got neglected completely. What a shame it didn't take off as expected. I had email conversation with **Sue Spence**, as she had done something similar in the past. I got some valuable advices from her. So thank you, Sue. In this project, I had the support of **Rick** (from Eligo) and **Fergus**. We even found space for the **"London Hack Day"**, thanks to **Fergus** for all the hard work. Unfortunately, I couldn't take it any further. Having said that, it is still active in my mind. Who knows, I might give it a fresh push in the year **2020**.

Going back to **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**, as the year 2019 coming to an end. I am planning to re-organise everything and make it even bigger event. So what is the plan? I try to keep it simple as much as possible so that I can do it myself without the need of financial help. I have done it so far and intended to carry on further as far as my health allows. Recently I have been diagnised with **Type 2 Diabetic**, I would blame my father for this. It is in our family. With young family to look after, it is not easy. But thanks to my lovely wife and 3 little angels, I have been able to come this far.

Just few days ago, I bought another domain **"rakuweeklychallenge.org"** and redirected the traffic back to **"perlweeklychallenge.org"**. Then while working on the renaming **"Perl6"** to **"Raku"**, it occurred to me, **"perlweeklychallenge.org"** is not just **"Perl"** weekly challenge but also **"Raku"** weekly challenge. Wouldn't it be nicer to have a neutral domain name? At this point, I bought another domain **"theweeklychallenge.org"**. To me this is best domain for the kind of challenges we are doing at the moment. As you know, our main focus are on **"Perl"** and **"Raku"**. But we also encourage members to try other languages also. We have had great response by the members with solutions in **C++**, **Python**, **Rust**, **Postscript** and **HTML**.

So the plan for the **Year 2020** are as below, I must make it clear that these are not mandatory. If **none** of it materialise for whatever reasons, I would carry on with the current format.

***

#### a) Move the website to proper web hosting provider

#### b) Make the website realtime and not static (keep the same look and feel). I am a big fan of Dancer2.

#### c) Allow the visitor to be able to give us feedback and comment.

#### d) Stop using @yahoo.com as email contact and have proper email @perlweeklychallenge.org

#### e) Last but not the least, find another Pete to sponsor the weekly winner quickly.

I haven't done anything this big before, so I don't know how to go about. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated. I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every members for the support and ecouragement.
