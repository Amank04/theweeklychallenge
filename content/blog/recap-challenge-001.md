Welcome to the first weekly recap of **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**.

*Apology for the delay, I was supposed to release this blog with the second challenge of the series. I promise next blog is going to be on time.*

For the first time ever, the Monday 25th March 2019, was not depressing like any other Monday. Thanks to **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**, I was so busy following public reactions on Twitter. It was a memorable experience. We had our first solution even before I had my first coffee of the day. Guess who submitted the very first solution?

It was by **Simon Proctor**. Not only he shared the solutions but by afternoon he even blogged about it. I had another surprise on the day was by **Lars Balker**. I just loved his solutions.

There were few other surprises as well. Big shots like, **Neil Bowers**, **Dave Cross**, **Philippe Bruhat**, **JJ Merelo** participated in the first challenge. Dave Cross even blogged about it. Philippe Bruhat sent me the detailed solution by email. I couldn't resist to make that as a blog for others to benefit from his knowledge.

I met **Dave Jacoby** on Twitter and found him very creative in his tweats but never knew he is such a great blogger. If you read his blog, you will understand what I mean. He explains every little things with so ease that any layman can understand.

Few days later, **Joelle Maslak** joined the party. The one and only girl in the team as of today, if I am not mistaken.

I am really thankfull to each and everyone for coming forward and encouraging. For the first time, I am doing something like this big. A day before the launch, **Gabor Szabo**, announced the Twitter handle **@PerlWChallenge** of the **"Perl Weekly Challenge"**.

How can I miss, **Kivanc Yazan**, the founder of **"Pull Request Club"**. He also participated in the first challenge. Then there was **Alexey Melezhik**, creator of **Sparrow**, joined the team as well.

A very good friend of mine, **Laurent Rosenfeld**, author of the book **"Think Perl6"** joined the team and contributed beautiful solutions. Not only that he even blogged about it.

I am really surprised by the amount of experience some of the team members have. With so many experts around, I am sure we would all get benefitted.

At the time of launch, I did not have clear plan how I am going to organise the solutions submitted by the team members. By mid week, I decided why not create a dedicated GitHub [repository](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club) and keep all the solutions there. There are at least 2 benefits from this.

1. **members can improve their solutions any time**
2. **they can even submit their solution as PR rather than email**

We are already in the second week and I have noticed, Pull Request is becoming the preferred choice. I am not complaining either.

The first member of the team was **Veesh Goldman**. Being an Indian by birth, I was so happy to see Perl hackers from India in the team. My expectation was lot more than this. I am still hopefull, with time more will join.

Here is list of blogs about the launch challenge. I must confess, just reading the blog would enlighten you so many new ideas. I have been doing Perl5 for more than 20 years now, still I found so many new interesting techniques. Since I have only recently started learning Perl6, I enjoyed Perl6 solutions as well. I highly recommend each of the listed blog. You will find plenty to learn from it.

It is practically not possible to list all the solutions. However you can take a look at the [repository](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-001).

Last but not the least, keep sharing your solutions and thanks for making it so fun and enjoyable.
