Every week, I release the challenge by email first and then on Twitter. I wait for about 30 minutes to get the first response to the challenge. I also look at the Google Analytics Realtime Chart to see how many users are reading the new challenge page and from which part of the world.

Last week, I didn't have to wait long, I saw the first reaction on Twitter from **Khalid**.

That message brought a big smile on my face.

The another came forward as tweet by **@smokemachine**.

## Challenge 1 (Perl 5 only)

I would like to talk about some solutions that surprised me. One of [them](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-003/adam-russell/perl5/ch-1.pl) was by **Adam Russell**. This solution used Perl5 **Closure** so cleanly. I would recommend anyone wants to learn about Closure.

There is another [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-003/andrezgz/perl5/ch-1.pl) by **Andrezgz**, it twisted my brain initially.

One [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-003/athanasius/perl5/ch-1.pl) by **Athanasius**, using CPAN module [HOP::Stream](https://metacpan.org/pod/HOP::Stream) interesting take.

Anybody wants to learn how to write well documented code then [this](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-003/duncan-c-white/perl5/ch-1.pl) is the best example by **Duncan C. White**.

**Joelle Maslak**, provided a complete application. You must take a look at [this](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-003/joelle-maslak/perl5/ch-1.pl).

Another well documented [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-003/khalid/perl5/ch-1.pl) by **Khalid**.

I would like to mention this [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-003/kian-meng-ang/perl5/ch-1.pl) by **Kian-Meng Ang**, well designed.

**Nick Logan** solution is always fun to read as he writes one [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-003/nick-logan/perl5/ch-1.pl) that keeps **Perl5** and **Perl6** happy.

As far as **Perl6** solutions, there were all too good for me.

## Challenge 2 (Perl 5 only)
I would mention again a very clean [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-003/adam-russell/perl5/ch-2.pl) by **Adam Russell**.

This [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-003/cliveholloway/perl5/ch-2.pl)by **Clive Holloway** has got nice display logic.

Here is [one](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-003/khalid/perl5/ch-2.pl) by **Khalid** displays the tree beautifully.

## Blogs

Following blogs have been reported last week. Each blog is a text book in itself as it teaches you so many things. I enjoyed reading each and every blog. Please do read them when you get time. There is one member, **Arne Sommer**, who is one those members, I always eagerly wait for the blog. His writing skill is brilliant.
