For the first time ever, I published RECAP blog before the weekly challenge. It is the sign that things are settling down. Members are using Pull Request more frequently to submit the solutions. Last Sunday, when I made the Challenge 004 public, I couple of people responded in no time.

The first person was **Kivanc Yazan** and he announced it on Twitter.

The next person followed him was **@smokemachine**. He has been regular since last week.

## Challenge 1 (Perl 5 only)
**Abigail** joined last week and submitted his [solutions](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-004/abigail).

**Adam Russell** solution for the second challenge of the week is worth reading. Please take a look [here](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/adam-russell/perl5/ch-2.pl).

**Alicia Bielsa** is another new member joined last week and submitted solutions to both challenges. I must point out the first [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/alicia-bielsa/perl5/ch-1.pl) using handy trick. I must confes that I didn't know about it before.

**Andrezgz** also submitted the similar [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/andrezgz/perl5/ch-1.pl) to the challenge 1 but using different library. Nice to know variations.

**Athanasius** presented another variations using the trick **__FILE__**. Short and sweet [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/athanasius/perl5/ch-1.pl).

**Daniel Mantovani** solution can be hard to read. I must say the logic is hard to decode. Do you want to try? [Checkout](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/daniel-mantovani/perl5/ch-1.pl) the code.

**Duncan C. White** has taken an absolutely different approach. Initially I had doubt whether it would print the desired result. But I was pleasantly surprised by the result. Must check his [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/duncan-c-white/perl5/ch-1.pl).

**Gustavo Chaves** [submitted](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/gustavo-chaves/perl5/ch-1.pl) the solution using the standard library. It is one of the most popular approach used by many members.

**Jaldhar H. Vyas** used unique approach to solve the challenge 1. Please take a [look](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/jaldhar-h-vyas/perl5/ch-1.pl).

**Dr James A Smith** submitted shortest [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/james-smith/perl5/ch-1.pl) for challenge 1.

**Jo Christian Oterhals** [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/jo-christian-oterhals/perl5/ch-1.pl) is also unique in approach.

I loved **Joelle Maslak** [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/joelle-maslak/perl5/ch-1.pl) to the challenge 1.

**John Barrett** [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/john-barrett/perl5/ch-1.pl) was also unique using external library.

**Kian-Meng Ang** pleasantly surprised me with the [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/kian-meng-ang/perl5/ch-1.pl) for the challenge 1.

**Kivanc Yazan** submitted the only [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/kivanc-yazan/perl5/ch-1.pl), which I found very different.

**Lars Balker** [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/lars-balker/perl5/ch-1.pl) is also very unique.

**Laurent Rosenfeld** is one of the few members who submit solutions in **Perl 5** and **Perl 6**. This time also his [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/laurent-rosenfeld/perl5/ch-1.sh) is truly unique.

**Nick Logan** polyglot [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/nick-logan/perl5/ch-1.pl) is always fun to read as always.

**Maxim Kolodyazhny** should get the most creative solution award. Why? Take a look at his [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/maxim-kolodyazhny/perl5/ch-1.pl).

**Ruben Westerberg** [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/ruben-westerberg/perl5/ch-1.pl) is always fun to read.

**Sergio Iglesias** [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/sergiotarxz/perl5/ch-1.pl) is a treat.

**Veesh Goldman** used nice little hack for challenge 1 [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/veesh-goldman/perl5/ch-1.pl).

## Challenge 2 (Perl 5 only)
**Andrezgz** [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/andrezgz/perl5/ch-2.pl) for challenge 2 is worth reading.

**Duncan C. White** [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/duncan-c-white/perl5/ch-2.pl) to the second challenge is elgantly simple.

**Nick Logan** [approach](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/nick-logan/perl5/ch-2.pl) to the second challenge is also interesting.

**Maxim Kolodyazhny** [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/maxim-kolodyazhny/perl5/ch-2.pl) to the second challenge is also very interesting.

**Neil Bowers** submitted only [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/neil-bowers/perl5/ch-2.pl) to challenge 2, which was short and sweet.

**Veesh Goldman** second [solution](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-004/veesh-goldman/perl5/ch-2.pl) is worth taking a look.
