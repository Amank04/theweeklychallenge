I would like to talk about **blog** written by some members this week. In the past, I went into the details of **Perl 5** solutions mainly. Lets change the trend this time.

Following blogs have been reported last week. Each blog is a text book in itself as it teaches you so many things. I enjoyed reading each and every blog. Please do read them when you get time.
