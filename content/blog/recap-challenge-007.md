Last week was better than the previous week. I noticed big rush on Saturday and Sunday always. As we are getting into 8th week, members are getting the hang of it, which is nice.

### Adam Russell

Adam once again came up with unique solution using **pack** and **unpack** to solve the challenge #1. I really liked the graph solution for challenge #2. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-007/adam-russell/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-007/adam-russell/perl5/ch-2.pl)] [[BLOG](https://adamcrussell.livejournal.com/2336.html)]

### Alicia Bielsa

Alicia submitted the solution to the challenge #1. It is simple, yet elegant. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-007/alicia-bielsa/perl5/ch-1.pl)]

### Andrezgz
![Andrezgz](/images/team/user.jpg)

Andrezgz solved the challenge #1 with the help of CPAN module **List::Util**. It turned out to be one-liner. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-007/andrezgz/perl5/ch-1.pl)]

### Athanasius
![Athanasius](/images/team/athanasius.jpg)

Athanasius solved the challenge #1 using the most popular logic. However the solution for challenge #2 is well thought out. You must checkout. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-007/athanasius/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-007/athanasius/perl5/ch-2.pl)]

### Arne Sommer
![Arne Sommer](/images/team/arne-sommer.jpg)

Arne always solved the challenges using **Perl 6**. His blog is very popular and not to be missed. [[BLOG](https://perl6.eu/niven-ladder.html)]

### Daniel Mantovani
![Daniel Mantovani](/images/team/daniel_mantovani.jpg)

Daniel solution to challenge #1 is readable and easy to follow. For challenge #2, he used Dijkstra algorithm like some other members but very well commented code. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-007/daniel-mantovani/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-007/daniel-mantovani/perl5/ch-2.pl)]

### Dave Jacoby

Dave solved the challenge #1 with the help of CPAN module List::Util. However the solution to the challenge #2 has many interesting points e.g. Storable and Graph. Checkout his well designed blog as well. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-007/dave-jacoby/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-007/dave-jacoby/perl5/ch-2.pl)] [[BLOG #1](https://jacoby.github.io//2019/05/06/niven-numbers-in-perl-and-javascript.html)] [[BLOG #2](https://jacoby.github.io//2019/05/06/rethinking-my-ladder-puzzle-code.html)]

### Guillermo Ramos
![Guillermo Ramos](/images/team/user.jpg)

Guillermo solution to challenge #1 is very interesting, using the **reduce** method of CPAN module List::Util. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-007/guillermo-ramos/perl5/ch-1.pl)]

### Gustavo Chaves
![Gustavo Chaves](/images/team/user.jpg)

Gustavo made use of all the tricks in the CPAN module List::Util for challenge #1. Really cool approach. For the challenge #2, he used Path::Tiny and Dijkstra's algorithm. Well defined solution. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-007/gustavo-chaves/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-007/gustavo-chaves/perl5/ch-2.pl)]

### Jaldhar H. Vyas
![Jaldhar H. Vyas](/images/team/jaldhar_vyas.jpg)

Jaldhar dedicated his solution to challenge #1 to his late father Dr. Harshad V. Vyas (1935-2019). I am really touched. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-007/jaldhar-h-vyas/perl5/ch-1.pl)]

### Joelle Maslak
![Joelle Maslak](/images/team/joelle_maslak.jpg)

Joelle is one of few membes who never missed challenge ever so far. She solved both the challenge in **Perl 5** and **Perl 6** while in sickbed. Hats off to her dedication. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-007/joelle-maslak/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-007/joelle-maslak/perl5/ch-2.pl)]

### Jo Christian Oterhals
![Jo Christian Oterhals](/images/team/user.jpg)

Jo submitted the solution in **Perl 6**. His blog is great for someone new to **Perl 6**, very well written. [[BLOG](https://medium.com/@jcoterhals/perl-6-small-stuff-19-a-challenge-of-niven-numbers-and-word-ladders-ed33dcd2b45b)]

### Kian-Meng Ang
![Kian-Meng Ang](/images/team/user.jpg)

Kian-Meng solution to the challenge #1 is very simple and easy to read. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-007/kian-meng-ang/perl5/ch-1.pl)]

### Laurent Rosenfeld
![Laurent Rosenfeld](/images/team/laurent_rosenfeld.jpg)

Laurent is one of the few members who consistently blog about his solutions. He also always submits solutions in **Perl 5** and **Perl 6**. His solution to the challenge #1 is a simple one-liner. No Brainer. However the solution for the challenge #2 is a real winner. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-007/laurent-rosenfeld/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-007/laurent-rosenfeld/perl5/ch-2.pl)] [[BLOG](http://blogs.perl.org/users/laurent_r/2019/05/perl-weekly-challenge-7-niven-numbers-and-word-ladders.html)]

### Maxim Nechaev
![Maxim Nechaev](/images/team/maxim-nechaev.jpg)

Maxim solution to challenge #1 used the same CPAN module List::Util like others. However his use of **grep** is new. However his solution for challenge #2 is really cool. Heavy use of CPAN modules like **Graph::Undirected** and **Algorithm::Combinatorics**. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-007/maxim-nechaev/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-007/maxim-nechaev/perl5/ch-2.pl)]

### Ruben Westerberg
![Ruben Westerberg](/images/team/user.jpg)

Ruben solved the challenge #1 with one-liner with usual hack. The solution to challenge #2 is real brain twister. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-007/ruben-westerberg/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2]](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-007/ruben-westerberg/perl5/ch-2.pl)]
