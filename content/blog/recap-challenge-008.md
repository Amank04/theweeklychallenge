The **Challenge - 008** participation was same as the **Challenge - 007** in terms of number of members participated. However this time we received more than solution with the introduction of the optional third API challenge. As a matter of fact, **Joelle Maslak** care to answer the third challenge. She solved the third challenge in **Perl5** and **Perl6**.

Francis analysis goes into detail of Perfect Numberes, a very unique approach. [[BLOG](https://rage.powered.ninja/2019/05/15/squaring-perfect-centre.html)]

### Guillermo Ramos
![Guillermo Ramos](/images/team/user.jpg)

Guillermo came up with simple and easy to follow solution. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-008/guillermo-ramos/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-008/guillermo-ramos/perl5/ch-2.pl)].

### Gustavo Chaves
![Gustavo Chaves](/images/team/gustavo-chaves.jpg)

Gustavo used **sum0()** from CPAN module **List::Util** to solve the perfect numbers challenge. I am really impressed with this solution. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-008/guillermo-ramos/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-008/guillermo-ramos/perl5/ch-2.pl)].

### Joelle Maslak
![Joelle Maslak](/images/team/joelle_maslak.jpg)

Joelle is one of few members who impressed me with the honest dedication. She is one of the few members who deals with both **Perl5** and **Perl6** equally. You can't afford to miss her solution. She is the only member who attempted to solve the optional third API challenge. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-008/joelle-maslak/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-008/joelle-maslak/perl5/ch-2.pl)] [[#3](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-008/joelle-maslak/perl5/ch-3.pl)].

### Kian-Meng Ang

### Neil Bowers
![Neil Bowers](/images/team/user.jpg)

Neil was the first member who came with the solution to the perfect numbers challenge. You can clearly see his style of coding. Welcome back Neil after a short break. [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-008/neil-bowers/perl5/ch-2.pl)].

### Maxim Nechaev
![Maxim Nechaev](/images/team/maxim-nechaev.jpg)

Maxim is the relative new the challenge but he really impressed me with this work. Check out his use of **oct()** to solve the perfect numbers challenge. Solution to the second challenge is also very impressive. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-008/maxim-nechaev/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-008/maxim-nechaev/perl5/ch-2.pl)].

### Ruben Westerberg

### Scimon Proctor
![Scimon Proctor](/images/team/simon_proctor.jpg)

Scimon is one of few members, who is comfortable in both **Perl5** and **Perl6**. However, I noticed recently, his focus is only on **Perl6**. [[BLOG](http://www.khanate.co.uk/blog/2019/05/14/perl-weekly-challenge-part-8/)].

### Yozen Hernandez
![Yozen Hernandex](/images/team/user.jpg)
