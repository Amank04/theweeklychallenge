I noticed few members came back after a short break. Welcome back. It is always nice to see you taking part in the weekly challenge. I hope to see you again and again. I would like to this opportunity to welcome new members. I hope you are having fun with the challenges. The moto of the weekly challenge is to have fun solving the challenges and learn from others. It feels nice when I hear positive feedbacks from the members. If you have any suggestions, please share with us. Enjoy the solutions and learn from each other.

### Adam Russell
![Adam Russell](/images/team/adam_russell.jpg)

Adam used CPAN modules like [Fstream](https://metacpan.org/pod/Fstream) and [Parse::YYLex](https://metacpan.org/pod/Parse::YYLex) to solve Roman numerals challenge. I must admit, I never heard of it before. But for Jaro-Winkler challenge, he relied on pure Perl power. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/adam-russell/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/adam-russell/perl5/ch-2.pl)] [[BLOG](https://adamcrussell.livejournal.com/3640.html)].

### Alicia Bielsa

Alicia use CPAN module [Readonly::Hash](https://metacpan.org/source/SANKO/Readonly-2.05/lib/Readonly.pm#PReadonly::Hash), which is part of Readonly distribution. In her solution, you will notice the power of Perl. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/alicia-bielsa/perl5/ch-1.pl)].

### Andrezgz
![Andrezgz](/images/team/user.jpg)

Andrezgz used the power of regex very elegantly. Roman numerals solution is a complete tool in itself. For Jaro-Winkler, it is back to basics but very organised code. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/andrezgz/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/andrezgz/perl5/ch-2.pl)].

### Arne Sommer
![Arne Sommer](/images/team/arne-sommer.jpg)

Arne Sommer, being on vacation last week, still managed to solve one of the challenge. If you look at the quality of his technical writing, it is priceless. A very good reference point for anyone learning Perl 6, very well explained in details. [[BLOG](https://perl6.eu/roman.html)].

### Athanasius
![Athanasius](/images/team/athanasius.jpg)

Athanasius use CPAN module [Const::Fast](https://metacpan.org/pod/Const::Fast) in his Roman numerals solution. It is simple yet elegant. For Jaro-Winkler challenge, he went for nicely name methods and detailed comments. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/athanasius/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/athanasius/perl5/ch-2.pl)].

### Daniel Mantovani
![Daniel Mantovani](/images/team/daniel_mantovani.jpg)

Daniel has taken very unique route to solve the Roman numerals challenge,  converting digit by digit. For Jaro-Winkler challenge, he took straight path. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/daniel-mantovani/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/daniel-mantovani/perl5/ch-2.pl)].

### E. Choroba
![E. Choroba](/images/team/e-choroba.jpg)

E. Choroba solution to the Roman numerals challenge still a mysetery to me. I am looking forward to his blog for explanation. But for Jaro-Winkler, he took the shortcut and used CPAN module [Text::JaroWinkler](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::JaroWinkler). [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/e-choroba/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/e-choroba/perl5/ch-2.pl)].

### Francis Whittle
![Francis Whittle](/images/team/user.jpg)

Francis is one of the few Perl6 experts in the team. He solved the challenge with the help of Grammar (Perl6). Please take a look if you want to learn more about Grammar in Perl6. [[BLOG](https://rage.powered.ninja/2019/06/02/obiective-romanos-grammaticam.html)].

### Guillermo Ramos
![Guillermo Ramos](/images/team/user.jpg)

Guillermo created a complete CLI app for Roman numerals challenge. It took me some time to understand his Jaro-Winkler solution. Please take a look. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/guillermo-ramos/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/guillermo-ramos/perl5/ch-2.pl)].

### Gustavo Chaves
![Gustavo Chaves](/images/team/gustavo-chaves.jpg)

Gustavo solution to Roman numerals is very intelligent. In a sense, it decides the conversion depends on the input value. Very smart. Jaro-Winkler solution is complicated. Not sure if it just me. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/gustavo-chaves/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/gustavo-chaves/perl5/ch-2.pl)].

### Jaldhar H. Vyas
![Jaldhar H. Vyas](/images/team/jaldhar_vyas.jpg)

Jaldhar used **given() when ()...** structure to solve the Roman numerals challenge. I have seen this after a long time. Thanks for the reminder. He also does **#Perl6** as well. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/jaldhar-h-vyas/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/jaldhar-h-vyas/perl5/ch-2.pl)].

### Joelle Maslak
![Joelle Maslak](/images/team/joelle_maslak.jpg)

Joelle as always shared her solutions in **Perl5** and **Perl6**. She is one the few who always solves the optional API challenge as well. Next week API challenge is also proposed by her. Checkout out her solutions to all three challenges. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/joelle-maslak/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/joelle-maslak/perl5/ch-2.pl)] [[#3](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/joelle-maslak/perl5/ch-3.pl)] [[BLOG](https://digitalbarbedwire.com/2019/06/01/converting-decimal-to-roman-numbers-in-perl-6/)].

### Kian-Meng Ang
![Kian-Meng Ang](/images/team/user.jpg)

Our in-house **#Perl5** reviewer, Kian-Meng, solved the Roman numerals challenge with complete breakdown of internals. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/kian-meng-ang/perl5/ch-1.pl)]

### Kivanc Yazan
![Kivanc Yazan](/images/team/user.jpg)

Kivanc came back after a short break with a bang. His solution to Roman numerals is short and sweet. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/kivanc-yazan/perl5/ch-1.pl)]

### Laurent Rosenfeld
![Laurent Rosenfeld](/images/team/laurent_rosenfeld.jpg)

As always, Laurent, shared plenty of variations in his approach. It is always fun reading his blog. He always presents his solu    tions in both Perl5 and Perl6. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/laurent-rosenfeld/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/laurent-rosenfeld/perl5/ch-2.pl)] [[BLOG](http://blogs.perl.org/users/laurent_r/2019/05/perl-weekly-challenge-10-roman-numerals-and-jaro-winkler-distance.html)].

### Maxim Nechaev
![Maxim Nechaev](/images/team/maxim-nechaev.jpg)

Maxim provided very simple and easy to follow solution to the Roman numerals challenge. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/maxim-nechaev/perl5/ch-1.pl)].

### Pavel Jurca
![Pavel Jurca](/images/team/user.jpg)

Pavel also came back after a short break with a nicely laid out solution to the Roman numerals. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/pavel-jurca/perl5/ch-1.pl)].

### Steven Wilson
![Steven Wilson](/images/team/user.jpg)

Steven came back after a short break with a complete solution including unit test. I loved it. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-010/steven-wilson/perl5/ch-1.pl)].

### Yozen Hernandez
![Yozen Hernandex](/images/team/user.jpg)

Yozen solution is very user-friendly as it has human touch to it. Well done. For Jaro-Winkler challenge, he used nice test data at the end.
