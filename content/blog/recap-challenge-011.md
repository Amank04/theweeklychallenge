I noticed members taking on the optional API challenge more regularly. Before only handfull members bother taking the challenge. I am also happy to see familiar faces coming back to the weekly challenge after short break. I hope they continue with it and enlighten us.

### Adam Russell

Adam solved the Fahrenheit-Celcius challenge in such a way that even a kid would follow it without any explanation. Simply Cool. He treated the second challenge of Identity Matrix in the similar fashion. Checkout his blog as well.

### Alicia Bielsa

Alicia approached the Fahrenheit-Celcius challenge is a very unique style. You must take a look. I also liked how she deals with the Indentity Matrix challenge so cleanly.

### Andrezgz
![Andrezgz](/images/team/user.jpg)

Andrezgz used **while loop** very smartly to solve the Fahrenheit-Celcius challenge. Even the Identity Matrix solution is very elegant. Please do take a look. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-011/andrezgz/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-011/andrezgz/perl5/ch-2.pl)]

### Arne Sommer

As always Arns came up with thorough explanation of his solutions to Challenge 011. It is always fun reading his blog. [[BLOG](https://perl6.eu/fc-matrix.html)]

### Athanasius
![Athanasius](/images/team/athanasius.jpg)

Athanasius solution for Fahrenheit-Celcius challenge is nicely structured. For the Indentity Matrix challenge, he used the CPAN module **Scalar::Util::Numeric**. He also attempted to solve the API challenge. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-011/athanasius/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-011/athanasius/perl5/ch-2.pl)] [[#3](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-011/athanasius/perl5/ch-3.pl)]

### Daniel Mantovani

Daniel only solved the first challenge Fahrenheit-Celcius challenge this time. His approach is really interesting. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-011/daniel-mantovani/perl5/ch-1.pl)]

### Dave Jacoby
![Dave Jacoby](/images/team/dave_jacoby.jpg)

Dave, as always, came up with full descriptive solution to the Farhenheit-Celcius challenge. He skipped the Identity Matrix challenge, instead solved the optional API challenge. Checkout his blog.

### Duncan C. White

Duncan solution to the Fahrenheit-Celcius challenge is very interesting. You must take a look. For Indentity Matrix, he cleverly used the cool trick.

### E. Choroba
![E. Choroba](/images/team/e-choroba.jpg)

I simply loved both the solutions to the Farhenheit-Celcius and Indentity Matrix challenge by Choroba. On top, he even explained in details in his blog.

### Gustavo Chaves
![Gustavo Chaves](/images/team/gustavo-chaves.jpg)

Gustavo is now regular face to the weekly challenge. You must read the comment in the script. It gives really interesting insight to the Fahrenheit-Celcisu challenge. For the Indentity Matrix, he took a simple straight forward path.
