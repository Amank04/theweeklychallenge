I was little late in releasing the weekly challenge last time. If I remember correctly it was around 4am Monday morning. Still, by 9am (UK time), I had first solution as PR by none other than the **Scimon Procotor** himself. And within the next hour, he submitted the solution to the second challenge. By lunch time, I had one more member **Ozzy** submitted solution to the first challenge.

This week, **Joelle Maslak** joined 100+ score club and became the second member. **Laurent Rosenfeld** was the first member.

Athanasius solution to Euclid number challenge is focussed on a very complex regex. You would need un-interrupted time to untangle the regex.
