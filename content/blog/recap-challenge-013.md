This week, **Joelle Maslak** sent us the first solution in **Perl6** as Pull Request [[#265](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/pull/265)]. Then came **Scimon Proctor**, again in **Perl6** as Pull Request [[#266](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/pull/266)]. **Kevin Colyer** submitted the next in **Perl6** as Github [gist](https://gist.github.com/kevincolyer/ed14f10c2da13d0d7367c25bf5aadb0d). By now, I started thinking where are all #Perl5 hackers. I didn't have to wait longer, **Pete Houston** sent us the solution in **Perl5** by email. Finally we had our first complete solution in **Perl5** by **Dave Jacoby** as Pull Request [[#271](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/pull/271)]. Chart started looking balanced.

The Perl Weekly Challenge 013 is also very special as it is the first challenge that has prize associated with it. It is always nice to be rewarded but we will keep the focus on **Fun** and **Knowledge Sharing**.

### Andrezgz

Like, most of the members, Andrezgz also used **DateTime** module to solve the friday challenge. For recursive method challenge, he kept it simple and clean. I noticed something really special **$/**. Any guesses?
