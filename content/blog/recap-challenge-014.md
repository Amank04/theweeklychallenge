Last week, **Dave Jacoby** sent us the first solution in **Perl5** as Pull Request [[#294](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/pull/294)]. Then came a new member, 95th member, **Robert Van Dam". Being a first timer, it didn't stop him in taking API challenge either.

We have had maximum number of new members joining last week. We now have **100** active members in the team. By the time, you are reading this, we have already declared our second winner. Please check the [Perl Weekly Challenge - 015](/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-015) blog to find out more.

Last but not the least, keep contributing to the weekly challenge, making sure we keep the focus on **Fun** and **Knowledge Sharing**.

Adam's solution to Van Eck's sequence is full of tricks. It took me sometime to get my head around it.
