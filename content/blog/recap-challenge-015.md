Let me welcome, **Veesh Goldman**, after a short break. He is the first member of the team. It is always nice to see member coming back after short break.

Last but not the least, keep contributing to the weekly challenge, making sure we keep the focus on **Fun** and **Knowledge Sharing**.

***

### Adam Russell
![Adam Russell](/images/team/adam_russell.jpg)

Adam surprised me with the use of prime url. Clean separation of method to filter strong and weak prime numbers. The Vigenere cipher solution is little hard to decode at first. But again, clean encode() and decode() subroutines to work with.

### Andrezgz

You must checkout the sub is_prime(). I am really impressed. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-015/andrezgz/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-015/andrezgz/perl5/ch-2.pl)]

### Arne Sommer

Arne blog as usual as its best. You can't afford to skip it. [[BLOG](https://perl6.eu/prime-vigenere.html)]

### Athanasius
![Athanasius](/images/team/athanasius.jpg)

I am a big fan of **CPAN**. Every time I see someone use CPAN module to solve the challenge, it makes me very happy. Athanasius used **Math::Prime::Util** to solve the challenge. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-015/athanasius/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-015/athanasius/perl5/ch-2.pl)] [[#3](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-015/athanasius/perl5/ch-3.pl)]

### Daniel Mantovani

Daniel came up with his special sub is_prime(). Please do check out. I have become a fan of him now. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-015/daniel-mantovani/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-015/daniel-mantovani/perl5/ch-2.pl)]

### Dave Jacoby
![Dave Jacoby](/images/team/dave_jacoby.jpg)

Dave raised a question in the beginning that really made me think again. Is 2 a prime number? [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-015/dave-jacoby/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-015/dave-jacoby/perl5/ch-2.pl)] [[#3](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-015/dave-jacoby/perl5/ch-3.pl)] [[BLOG](https://jacoby.github.io/2019/07/01/perl-weekly-challenge-015.html)]

### Duane Powell

Duane also used **Math::Prime::Util** module to solve the challenge. I am impressed how he used pack/unpack to solve Vigenere cipher challenge. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-015/duane-powell/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-015/duane-powell/perl5/ch-2.pl)]

### Duncan C. White

Reading Duncan's code is always a pleasure. It appears to be a poetry to me every time. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-015/duncan-c-white/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-015/duncan-c-white/perl5/ch-2.pl)]

### E. Choroba
![E. Choroba](/images/team/e-choroba.jpg)

I have noticed one thing in Choroba's solution is that he always go for CPAN module if available otherwise he creates one. It makes the final solution just few lines of code. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-015/e-choroba/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-015/e-choroba/perl5/ch-2.pl)] [[BLOG](http://blogs.perl.org/users/e_choroba/2019/07/perl-weekly-challenge-015-strong-and-weak-primes-and-vigenere-cipher.html)]

### Guillermo Ramos
![Guillermo Ramos](/images/team/user.jpg)

I loved the Vigenere cipher solution the most. You must check out. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-015/guillermo-ramos/perl5/ch-1.pl)] [[#2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-015/guillermo-ramos/perl5/ch-2.pl)] [[#3](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-015/guillermo-ramos/perl5/ch-3.pl)]

### Gustavo Chaves
![Gustavo Chaves](/images/team/gustavo-chaves.jpg)

Kudos to Gustavo for keeping the prime number challenge solution so simple yet elegant. Same goes for Vigenere cipher challenge.

### Joelle Maslak
![Joelle Maslak](/images/team/joelle_maslak.jpg)

I follow Joelle very closely on Twitter. Sometimes I wonder how she manages to find time for the weekly challenge. She is the most dedicated member of the team.

### Kian-Meng Ang
![Kian-Meng Ang](/images/team/user.jpg)

Our in-house Perl5 reviews, Kian-Meng, solved the prime number challenge using **ntheory**. I must admit, I wasn't aware of this module before. [[#1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-015/kian-meng-ang/perl5/ch-1.pl)]

### Laurent Rosenfeld
![Laurent Rosenfeld](/images/team/laurent_rosenfeld.jpg)

Laurent is unmatchable in his analysis of challenges. He is great in presenting result of his analysis. At the end it looks so simple and easy. Functional programming became a special feature of Laurent blog now a days. I have learnt a lot by reading his blog.

### Lubos Kolouch
![Lubos Kolouch](/images/team/lubos_kolouch.jpg)
