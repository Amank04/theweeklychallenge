I would like to share this [blog](http://blogs.perl.org/users/damian_conway/2019/07/infinite-work-is-less-work.html) by **Damian Conway** where he shared his view with regard to the **"Strong/Weak prime numbers"** task of [Perl Weekly Challenge - 015](/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-015). You must have noticed **Neil Bowers** love for the optional API task. Last week **DetectLanguage API** task was another example where he created CPAN distribution [WebService::DetectLanguage](https://metacpan.org/release/WebService-DetectLanguage) for the API task. It is now even listed as official **Perl Client** on their [website](https://detectlanguage.com/).

Last but not the least, keep contributing to the weekly challenge, making sure we keep the focus on **Fun** and **Knowledge Sharing**.
