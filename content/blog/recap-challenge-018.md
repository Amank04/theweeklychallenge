Last week, we had a guest contributor, **Orestis Zekai**, works as a **Software Engineer**. He doesn't know **Perl** but fluent in **Python**. He came across earlier weekly challenges and found it fun. So he decided to solve the **Perl Weekly Challenge - 018** using **Python** language, [Task #1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-018/orestis-zekai/python/ch-1.py) and [Task #2](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-018/orestis-zekai/python/ch-2.py). He wouldn't be part of weekly competition, though.

Last but not the least, keep contributing to the weekly challenge, making sure we keep the focus on **Fun** and **Knowledge Sharing**.
