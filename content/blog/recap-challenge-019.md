The main attraction of last week challenge was **Dave Cross**. Why? Because it managed to brought **Dave Cross** back in action. He didn't just stop there but he even blogged about it. We noticed some of the active members being busy getting ready for next week **Perl Conference in Riga**. We would like to thank each members for taking time out in the busy schedule and participarted in the weekly challenge.

Last but not the least, keep contributing to the weekly challenge, making sure we keep the focus on **Fun** and **Knowledge Sharing**.
