We are now **3 months old** and growing fast every week with the support of wider Perl Community.

The prime motto of the **"Perl Weekly Challenge"** is to promote Perl (be it **Perl5** or **Perl6**). I was looking for fun way of doing it. Being, co-editor of [Perl Weekly](http://perlweekly.com/) newsletter, I noticed that not many people blog about interesting use of the language. I must say, **Perl6** community is doing far better than **Perl5**. It is not that **Perl5** community is not active. They are but only limited to **Conferences** and **Workshops**. So I thought of creating a platform to bring active members of **Perl5** and **Perl6** communities together to solve fun tasks. While doing so, I wanted to allow relatively new members of the community as well to participate the weekly challenge. Keeping this in mind, I came up with weekly challenge comprises of two tasks, one aimed for **beginners** and other for **experts**.

Since I always wanted to promote the language, I decided to encourgage members to blog about their solutions. I can see the affect of the weekly challenge, we now get on average **8-10** blog posts together for **Perl5** and **Perl6** every week. Each blog has its own style and teaches you something special every time. Please do checkout the dedicated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club) and enjoy.

The best part of the **Perl Weekly Challenge** is that you get to know so many hidden talent from around the world. We use social platform like **Twitter** to start interesting dicussions and share our thoughts. If you are active on **Twitter** than please do [join us](https://twitter.com/PerlWChallenge).

Recently **Pete Sergeant** of [PerlCareers](https://perl.careers/) came forward to sponsor the prize of **Perl Weekly Challenge** with reward of **$50 Amazon voucher**. It was first introduced in the **"Perl Weekly Challenge - 013"**. At the end, we got our first winner as **"Laurent Rosenfeld"**. The best part of his contribution is that he always solved the weekly challenges in both **Perl5** and **Perl6**. He doesn't just stop there, he even publishes detailed blog sbout it.

Please check out his recent contributions, [CODE](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-013/laurent-rosenfeld) and [BLOG](http://blogs.perl.org/users/laurent_r/2019/06/perl-weekly-challenge-13-fridays-and-mutually-recursive-subroutines.html).

Icing on the cake was when I noticed **Damian Conway**, wrote not **one** but **three** blog about the weekly challenges and how **Perl6** can help you solve the tasks as listed below:

1) [Why I love Perl 6](http://blogs.perl.org/users/damian_conway/2019/05/why-i-love-perl-6.html)

2) [Coding with a full toolset](http://blogs.perl.org/users/damian_conway/2019/06/coding-with-a-full-toolset.html)

3) [Coding with an even fuller toolset](http://blogs.perl.org/users/damian_conway/2019/06/coding-with-an-even-fuller-toolset.html)

Some team members even suggest tasks for the week;y challenges. Recently, **Neil Bowers**, proposed very interesting task and [blogged](http://neilb.org/2019/06/24/additional-challenge-14.html) about it as I misunderstood the task initially.

We even introduced third task specifically related to creating perl interface to the popular API as suggested by **Gabor Szabo**. Although API task is optional, It is becoming fast popular among members that **Neil Bowers** even released a CPAN distribution [WebService::WordsAPI](https://metacpan.org/release/WebService-WordsAPI) in response to recent [API task](/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-014/).

If you want to have fun and learn then do join the team by dropping a line to **perlweeklychallenge@yahoo.com** with your name, city and country. For more information, please check out [FAQ](/faq) page.

Last but not the least, I would like to thank each and every one for the support and encourgagement.

Keep contributing and sharing knowledge.
