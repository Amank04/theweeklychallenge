  We are bunch of Perl 5 and  Perl 6 hackers. The main purpose behind this project is to learn something new from others. The most important thing is to have fun. We will try to keep it simple and easy for anyone to join us. You don't need to be an expert in the language, is the core point. Even if you are new to the language, you will find some easy challenge to start with. Take my example, I have recently started learning Perl 6, I will take on easy challenge to test my knowledge and learn new stuff. Please rest assure, the tone is going to be friendly and welcoming. Feel free to ask any questions with regard to the choice of your language. And if you are an expert in the language then please take on newcomer and give a helping a hand.
