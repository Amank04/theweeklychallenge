title   : Who are we?
description: >
  We are a bunch of Perl 5 and  Perl 6 hackers. The main purpose behind this project is to learn something new from each other. The most important thing is to have fun. We will try to keep it simple and easy for anyone to join us. The main point is that you don't need to be an expert in the language. Even if you are new to the language, you will find some easy challenges to start with. Take me for example, I have recently started learning Perl 6 and I will be taking on easy challenges to test my knowledge and learn new stuff. Feel free to ask any questions with regard to the choice of your language. And if you are an expert in the language then please take on a newbie and give a helping hand.
