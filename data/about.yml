description: >
  We are bunch of Perl 5 and  Perl 6 hackers. The main purpose behind this project is to learn something new from each others. The most important thing is to have fun. We will try to keep it simple and easy for anyone to join us. You don't need to be an expert in the language, is the core point. Even if you are new to the language, you will find some easy challenge to start with. Take my example, I have recently started learning Perl 6, I will be taking on easy challenges to test my knowledge and learn new stuff. Feel free to ask any questions with regard to the choice of your language. And if you are an expert in the language then please take on newbie and give a helping hand.
