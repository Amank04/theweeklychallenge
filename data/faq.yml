title   : FREQUENT ASKED QUESTIONS
questions :
  - question : How can I join the "Perl Weekly Challenge"?
    answer : You can send a one line email to perlweeklychallenge@yahoo.com. However we would like you to tell us about yourself in couple of lines e.g. your preferred choice of language, how long you have been using the language, your city and country. If you could send us a recent photo to show on the team page then that would be great, but it isn't required.

  - question : When do you send the challenge?
    answer : The plan is to send the weekly challenge to all subscribed team members every Monday.

  - question : Do I have to solve the challenge every week?
    answer : Not necessarily, but it would be nice if you did. You can skip the challenge if you are too busy and come back the following week.

  - question : Is there going to be a winner of the "Perl Weekly Challenge"?
    answer : Every Monday, we will blog about submitted solutions in the previous week. For every working solution, you get 2 stars. In total you could get 8 stars by submitting your solutions to both questions in Perl and Raku. If you blog about your solution and share the link with us, then you get 2 bonus stars. And if you become a mentor for a week then you get 5 stars for your efforts. There are no winners or losers.

  - question : Do you review the solutions submitted by the members every week?
    answer : As of today, we do RECAP, which is just an overview of the submitted solutions. Then there is Perl solutions thorough review by Kian-Meng Ang every week. Recently we started Raku solutions thorough review by Laurent Rosenfeld. There is plenty to keep you busy all week. If you have any ideas then please do share with us.

  - question : Is there a prize for the weekly challenge?
    answer : Starting from the weekly Challenge 013, we picked one member randomly from the members who participated in the weekly challenge. From January 2020, we would now declare monthly winner. The more solutions you submit the higher the chance of you winning the weekly challenge. The prize is $50 Amazon voucher kindly donated by Peter Sergeant of PerlCareers.

  - question : What else can we do, other than solving the weekly challenge?
    answer : You can contribute new challenges with possible solutions. Or you can enroll yourself as a "mentor" to help others in the team.

  - question : What if I am unable to solve a challenge?
    answer : No worries. If you can't solve the challenge, just wait for the announcement of the winning solution and you will find out how it was done. Or if you need help just request a "mentor" and we will provide one. This will be private between you and the mentor and no-one else will know about it. This is just for the assigned challenge.

  - question : How do you want us to send the solution?
    answer : You can either email the solution to perlweeklychallenge@yahoo.com or you could blog about it and send us the link to the blog. Your solution should reach us by midnight the following Sunday. Or, if you prefer, you can submit your solution as a Pull Request to the GitHub repository (https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club).

  - question : Can I pick and choose my preferred language?
    answer : Certainly. You are free to choose your preferred language. In fact you can choose a different language each week, e.g. Perl one week and Raku the following week. Or why not both?

  - question : Is the challenge going to be beginner-friendly?
    answer : Of course. The point of the Perl Weekly Challenge is to bring new people into the Perl/Raku fold. At the same time, there will be some challenges for experts as well.

  - question : What If I don't want to receive the challenge?
    answer : Just send us a one line email telling us, and we will not send you the challenge.

  - question : How about those who follow you on Twitter?
    answer : Anyone who follows us on @PerlWChallenge can also take part in the challenge by sending us the solution as mentioned previously. You will also get instant news and update about the challenge.

  - question : How often do you send email to the team?
    answer : In total two emails each week - one with the weekly challenge and another with the weekly update. We might merge the two into one, if it's possible. You can opt-out if you want.

  - question : How can I share new ideas and suggestions with you?
    answer : Simply email us perlweeklychallenge@yahoo.com. We respect your views and will keep it private.

  - question : Is my email address safe with you?
    answer: There shouldn't be any doubt about it. We will never share your email address with anyone.
