      <description>Get to know about PokGoPun. Welcome to the monthly series Meet The Champion.
Last month we spoke to Robert Ransbottom, the winner of May 2022.
Today we are talking to PokGoPun, the winner of June 2022 of The Weekly Challenge. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.
 Mohammad: Tell us about your technical background?
PokGoPun: My passion in computer programming started since childhood when my parents brought home 8-bit home computer that equipped with Microsoft Extended BASIC, I recalled hooking the computer to TV, writing and running BASIC programs and then saving them to cassette tape for later modification, what a fun!</description>

Welcome to the Perl review pages for Week 170 of The Weekly Challenge! Here we will take the time to discuss the submissions offered up by the team, factor out some common methodologies that came up in those solutions, and highlight some of the unique approaches and unusual code created.
 ●︎ Why do we do these challenges? I suppose any reasonable answer to that question would be from a field as wide ranging and varied as the people who choose to join the team.</description>
