      <description>Advent Calendar 2023 | Day 21 | Day 22 |  The gift is presented by Augie De Blieck Jr.. Today he is talking about his solution to The Weekly Challenge - 238. This is re-produced for Advent Calendar 2023 from the original post.
 The Weekly Challenge began as a Perl-focused exercise but has since expanded to let any and all languages in. It’s still mostly Perl, but I’ll be using it as an avenue to explore other languages, as well.</description>

      <description>Advent Calendar 2023 | Day 20 | Day 21 | Day 22 |  The gift is presented by Yves Orton. Today he is talking about his solution to The Weekly Challenge - 237. This is re-produced for Advent Calendar 2023 from the original post.
 Seize The Day - Simple Rules The Day  My solution was based on using Time::Local to compute the epoch for noon on the first day of the month, and then stepping forward by day until the required day of week has been found, and then stepping forward by week until the required repetition of that day has been found, or we ran off the end of the calender month.</description>
