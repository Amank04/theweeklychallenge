      <description>( &amp;hellip;continues from previous week. )
Welcome to the Perl review pages for Week 180 of The Weekly Challenge! Here we will take the time to discuss the submissions offered up by the team, factor out some common methodologies that came up in those solutions, and highlight some of the unique approaches and unusual code created.
 ●︎ Why do we do these challenges? I suppose any reasonable answer to that question would come from a field as wide ranging and varied as the people who choose to join the team.</description>
