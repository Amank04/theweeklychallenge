      <description>As you know, Perl Weekly Challenge, primarily focus on Perl and Raku. During the Week #018, we received the solution to &amp;ldquo;Perl Weekly Challenge - 018&amp;rdquo; by Oretis Zekai in Python. It was a pleasant surprise to receive solution in something other than Perl and Raku. Ever since regular team members also started contributing in other languages like C++, Postscript, Rust and HTML.

      <description>HELP: How to contribute? Just submit Pull Request to GitHub repository with your solutions. First find out the latest challenge folder, more likely the highest numbered folder is the latest challenge folder e.g. challenge-002. If you are an existing member, you would probably find a folder by your name. For example, if your name is &amp;ldquo;Joe Blog&amp;rdquo; then there would be a folder called &amp;ldquo;joe-blog&amp;rdquo;. Under your named folder, you would find a file README.</description>

In the very first week, He submitted solutions in Perl5 and Perl6. Well he didn&amp;rsquo;t stop there, he even blogged about it. Did he stop there? Well not, he started solving all the past challenges. In the series, he started with Perl Weekly Challenge - 001, [P5 #1], [P5 #2], [P6 #1] and [P6 #2].</description>

For a quick overview, go through the original tasks and recap of the weekly challenge.
We&amp;rsquo;re going to review thing a bit differently for this week by listing down all the CPAN modules used for a particular task. The modules usage reflects three things, the coding style of a participant (Function::Parameters) the common used module (Math::Prime::Util) to solve a particular problem, and the trend of module usage (Modern::Perl) which was seen quite often in the last few challenges.</description>

      <description>HEADLINES Last week, we had a guest contributor, Orestis Zekai, works as a Software Engineer. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t know Perl but fluent in Python. He came across earlier weekly challenges and found it fun. So he decided to solve the Perl Weekly Challenge - 018 using Python language, Task #1 and Task #2. He wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be part of weekly competition, though.
Last but not the least, keep contributing to the weekly challenge, making sure we keep the focus on Fun and Knowledge Sharing.</description>

      <description>I have been thinking to do review of optional API task so far. I have now finally got the time.
BACKGROUND During the Perl Weekly challenge 005, Gabor Szabo, Chief Editor of Perl Weekly newsletter proposed optional API task to the weekly challenge. He even suggested list of API that I could use every week. It took me couple of weeks to figure out the format and other formalities. Finally it was introduced with the Perl Weekly Challenge - 008.</description>

      <description>We are now 3 months old and growing fast every week with the support of wider Perl Community.
The prime motto of the &amp;ldquo;Perl Weekly Challenge&amp;rdquo; is to promote Perl (be it Perl5 or Perl6). I was looking for fun way of doing it. Being, co-editor of Perl Weekly newsletter, I noticed that not many people blog about interesting use of the language. I must say, Perl6 community is doing far better than Perl5.</description>

Moreover, some of these show case the expressiveness of Perl programming language itself, which is also one of the key goal of this weekly challenge.</description>

By lunch time, I had one more member Ozzy submitted solution to the first challenge.

For those who are new to the weekly review post, the main purpose of weekly review is to document down interesting approaches of using Perl programming language to solve each week challenges. Code reading or review allows us to learn / relearn, discover / rediscover, and appreciate / reappreciate (some participants uses other programming languages in their day job) new, interesting, and quirky things accomplished with Perl (unfortunately Perl 5 for now).</description>

For a quick overview, read through the questions and recap of the challenge.
Challenge #1 The Wikipage page have a good introduction and manual calculation of conversion of Arabic numerals to Roman numerals. Read Laurent Rosenfeld&amp;rsquo;s blog post for the finer implementation details.
Most participants uses a hash to map between Arabic and Roman numerals. Since order of the matching roman numerals against the Arabic values is important, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to sort it before any conversion.</description>

      <description>I came to know about one secret player of Perl Weekly Challenge just few days ago. Any guesses? He is the Damian Conway. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t need any introduction. My first encounter with him was when I bought his book Perl Best Practices. I have been a big fan of him since then. Checkout his blog. I would also like to mention another newly joined member Yozen Hernandez. He blogged first time ever that too about his solution to the Perl Weekly Challenge.</description>

      <description>I would like to this opportunity to thank one of the respected member Kian-Meng Ang for the help in reviewing Perl 5 challenges every week. Checkout her last review if you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen already. Ever since I started reviewing the challenges, I am looking for volunteer to do the same for Perl 6. I know it is weekly commitment and can be tiresome. If we can create team of reviewers for each languages then it would be even more fun.</description>

She solved the third challenge in Perl5 and Perl6.
Adam Russell Adam making good use of unpack() to solve the perfect numbers challenge.</description>

      <description>Below is the write-up review (only covers Perl 5) of the Perl Weekly Challenge #007 of all the submitted answers. You can read the original questions first to understand the details of these two challenges.
Challenge #1 If we read the question carefully, there are several steps to solve this problem. First, to find all niven number from 0 to 50 inclusively. Second, to find the sum of its digits of this range of number.</description>

      <description>Last week was better than the previous week. I noticed big rush on Saturday and Sunday always. As we are getting into 8th week, members are getting the hang of it, which is nice.
Adam Russell Adam once again came up with unique solution using pack and unpack to solve the challenge #1. I really liked the graph solution for challenge #2. [#1] [#2] [BLOG]

      <description>Last week was not very active in terms of number of participations. Having said that the quality of the solutions is always on the top. Some went for the kill, you can&amp;rsquo;t afford to miss it. Enjoy the code.
Adam Russell Adam got the help from CPAN module Data::Dump and the end result is unbelievable simple. Check out his code.

      <description>Perl Weekly Challenge introduced me to so many genious around the globe. It would be unfair to name a few. You know who I am talking about. The main objective of the project was to introduce Perl to more people and allow sharing the magic of Perl. In the last 5 weeks, I can say that I have personally learnt a lot from many greats.

      <description>I would like to talk about blog written by some members this week. In the past, I went into the details of Perl 5 solutions mainly. Lets change the trend this time.
Following blogs have been reported last week. Each blog is a text book in itself as it teaches you so many things. I enjoyed reading each and every blog. Please do read them when you get time.</description>

      <description>The best part of the Perl Weekly Challenge is reading the blog by the members. Personally, I like the journey of an idea to final solution. If you look at closely all the blogs, every member has unique style. They all think differently but ends up with the same result. I have become fan of few in the last few weeks. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, reading code is fascinating but boring.</description>

      <description>For the first time ever, I published RECAP blog before the weekly challenge. It is the sign that things are settling down. Members are using Pull Request more frequently to submit the solutions. Last Sunday, when I made the Challenge 004 public, I couple of people responded in no time.
The first person was Kivanc Yazan and he announced it on Twitter.
The next person followed him was @smokemachine. He has been regular since last week.</description>

      <description>I noticed last week, less participation than the previous week. Why? Honestly speaking I have no clue. Could it be the questions were too tricky for the challenge? The week before, I received the feedback that the questions were too easy and simple. So I went for little trickier one this time. It seems that I have to balance it somehow.
I am gratefull to all members submitting the solutions as Pull Request.</description>

I also look at the Google Analytics Realtime Chart to see how many users are reading the new challenge page and from which part of the world.
Last week, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to wait long, I saw the first reaction on Twitter from Khalid.</description>

      <description>As received in response to the challenge by Philippe Bruhat. Highly recommended.
 Write a script or one-liner to remove leading zeros from positive numbers.
 As a filter:
perl -ple &#39;s/^0+//&#39;  Challenge #2  Write a script that can convert numbers to and from a base35 representation, using the characters 0-9 and A-Y.
 Those who remember The Perl Review Code golf contest may remember this challenge.</description>

      <description>I noticed the timing of releasing the weekly challenge is not helping anyone in UK timezone as I released around mid-night. So if somebody who lives in other side where it is day they get to try the challenge first. I realised within few hours of making the challenge public, I starts getting feedback but none from UK member. It is only when it is Monday morning, I see reactions from them.</description>

      <description>Last week challenge turned out to be a cakewalk for Perl 6 hackers. This shows my lack of knowledge of Perl 6. I have requested our inhouse Perl 6 experts to share some challenging questions. I already received few and kept in the challenge bank. I will use it in the coming weeks. Credit will be given to the hacker when published. We highly recommend that you submit you solutions as PR to the repository.</description>
