      <description>After so many years, I finally got around to contribute to Perl Advent Calendar 2022. For me personally, it is an honour to be part of it. I have contributed in the past so I am aware of its reach. I grab the opportunity every time I get the offer.
This time around, Olaf Alders, is leading the team and managing the Perl Advent Calendar 2022. As always the case, this year also the calendar is full of interesting topics to keep you busy in this holiday season.</description>
