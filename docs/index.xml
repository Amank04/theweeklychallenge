Welcome to the Perl review for Week 105 of the Weekly Challenge! Here we will take the time to discuss the submissions offered by the team, factor out the common methodologies that came up in those solutions, and highlight some of the unique approaches and unusual code created.
 Why do we do these challenges? I suppose any answers to that would be as wide ranging and varied as the people who choose to join the team.</description>

      <description>As you know, The Weekly Challenge, primarily focus on Perl and Raku. During the Week #018, we received solutions to &amp;ldquo;The Weekly Challenge - 018&amp;rdquo; by Orestis Zekai in Python. It was pleasant surprise to receive solutions in something other than Perl and Raku. Ever since regular team members also started contributing in other languages like Ada, APL, Awk, Basic, Bash, Bc, Befunge, BQN, Brainfuck, C, Chef, COBOL, C Shell, C++, Clojure, D, Dart, Elm, Erlang, Fish, Forth, Fortran, Gembase, GNAT, Go, Haskell, Haxe, HTML, Idris, Janet, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, Lisp, Lua, Macro Processor, Mumps, Nim, Node.</description>

Well, it is confirmed by my GP that I am going through Depression &amp;amp; Anxiety.
So now you know why I didn&amp;rsquo;t do live video session in the recent weeks.
I was even thinking on dropping the idea of participating in the weekly challenge for couple of weeks.</description>

Welcome to the Perl review for Week 080 of the Weekly Challenge! Here we will take the time to discuss the submissions offered by the team, factor out the common methodologies that came up in those solutions, and highlight some of the unique approaches and unusual code created.
Or really, talk about pretty much anything that stands out as remarkable or noteworthy.
Every week there is an enormous global collective effort made by the team, analyzing and creatively coding the submissions, and that effort deserves credit due.</description>

      <description>HEADLINE I am back to my routine life but still not there fully. I am going to talk about my Perl and Raku solutions to both tasks to start with. Last week, I only talked about my Perl and Raku solutions to the task Prime Sum. This week also, I skipped Swift contributions like last week, sorry. I would blame my laziness.
I am happy with my effort this week. It gives me immense pleasure when I do Raku implementation completely different from Perl.</description>

      <description>HEADLINE Although I had finished the &amp;ldquo;Word Search&amp;rdquo; task a week before, still I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to complete the &amp;ldquo;Prime Sum&amp;rdquo; task. After checking out others solution to the &amp;ldquo;Word Search&amp;rdquo; task, I was feeling low looking back my own solution. To recover from it, I delayed solving the &amp;ldquo;Prime Sum&amp;rdquo; task. At the same time, as a protest, I didn&amp;rsquo;t do Swift solutions for any of the tasks. After few days when I was feeling a little better, I decided to do at least one task better.</description>

Welcome to the Perl review for Week 074 of the Weekly Challenge! Here we will take the time to discuss the submissions offered by the team, factor out the common methodologies that came up in those solutions, and highlight some of the unique approaches and unusual code created.
Or really, talk about pretty much anything that stands out as remarkable or noteworthy.
Every week there is an enormous global collective effort made by the team, analyzing and creatively coding the submissions, and that effort deserves credit due.</description>

      <description>HEADLINE The week #075 tasks turned out to be a lot trickier than expected. Generally Task #1 is meant for beginners only but this time it was not the case. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t my plan when I proposed the task. I thought couple of for-loops and job done. But when I actually started working on the task, I realised it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as simple as I thought initially. But the good thing is, I got to know about Dynamic Programming (DP).</description>

      <description>HEADLINES  Lets welcome new member Nuno Vieira from Braga, Portugal before we discuss anything.
I remember last Monday as soon as I made the weekly challenge public, within minutes literally, I had the first contributions.
Guess who? Mark Anderson, one of the member of elite Early Bird Club.
Do you also want to join the club? It is very simple, just drop us a line at perlweeklychallenge@yahoo.com.
I wanted to be the first contributor as I had solved both the tasks in Perl, Raku and Swift already.</description>

      <description>HEADLINES  Well done Team PWC, we did it. It took us 74 weeks to break the record of 2 consecutive weeks of 100+ contributions. Just to remind you it was right at the start, Week #001 and Week #002. In between we did manage to cross the magical number but never once crossed 3 in a row.
1) Week #001: 142 2) Week #002: 109 3) Week #030: 115 4) Week #033: 108 5) Week #046: 106 6) Week #072: 109 7) Week #073: 108 8) Week #074: 112 Having done this now, we should now aim to break the record of maximum contributions in a week.</description>

      <description>HEADLINE Ever since I started doing Swift, I find myself too busy again with my weekly video sessions on top of all.
I need to re-visit my time management chart, may be?
Having said that, I get excited by the doing task in a new language. I wanted to do it in Java to refresh my memory. But couldn&amp;rsquo;t find time for it as I am editing the next week Perl Weekly newsletter also.</description>

      <description>HEADLINES  The week #072 was full of pleasant surprises, one of them was getting past 100 contributions. The whole Team PWC needs a big round of applause. Having set the target so high, the following week #073 was under pressure to perform. Honestly speaking, it was me who wanted to get somewhere close to the peak if not beat the previous high.
To keep the followers of @PerlWChallenge up to date, I kept sharing the progress during the week.</description>

      <description>HEADLINES  Welcome back Mano Chandar. Although he joined the Team PWC long time ago but he shared his first contributions in Perl this week.
I am not sure if you noticed, in the recent weeks, the language list is growing very rapidly. As of today, we have received solutions in 24 languages in addition to Perl and Raku. If you remember, it all started in the week #018 by a respected guest Orestis Zekai when he shared his solutions in Python.</description>

      <description>HEADLINE No Linked List related task this week?
I am glad, this week focus was more Array/List related. Technical speaking Array and List aren&amp;rsquo;t the same in Perl. I must admit until I read the article by brian d foy, I thought they were the same. As the famous saying, you learn something new every day.
Both the tasks, this week were not terribly difficult. I noticed many members of Team PWC attempted other languages because they finished the tasks in no time.</description>

      <description>HEADLINE With another Linked List related task, I am now enjoying it a lot. It also gives me the opportunity to work with Class in Raku. Learning Raku has changed my thinking a big way. The developer inside me is more organised than before. Also doing regular weekly challenge made me think from unit test point of view every time I come up with a solution. In fact, it dictates the design of my solution.</description>

      <description>( &amp;hellip;continues from previous week. )
Welcome to the Perl review for Week 069 of the Weekly Challenge! Here we will take the time to discuss the submissions offered by the team, factor out the common methodologies that came up in those solutions, and highlight some of the unique approaches and unusual code we find.
Or really, talk about pretty much anything that stands out as remarkable or noteworthy.
Every week there is an enormous global collective effort made by the team, analyzing and creatively coding the submissions, and that effort deserves credit due.</description>

      <description>HEADLINES  Finally the wait is over, we found volunteer for Raku Reviews.
Any guess?
Andrew Shitov joined the team of Raku Reviewers. The best part is, he is doing Live Video Reviews, which is even more fun. I watched all his reviews so far, start to end. There are plenty to learn from just watching him review Raku solutions. He has already done for Week #066 and Week #069.</description>

      <description>HEADLINE Before I talk about my contribution this week, I would like to talk about my encounter with Swift programming language recently. For the first time, I felt confident that I can share my Swift solution to the Character Swapping task of the Perl Weekly Challenge - 070. Why Task #1 only? Well, you guessed it correctly because it is meant for the beginners. With the submission of my first contribution in Guest Language, I now find myself in the Guest List as you must have seen in RECAPS every week.</description>

It is different from others. I am not sure about others but I always look forward to review every week. We are still looking for helping hands for Raku reviews.

Walt Mankowski surprised me this week by sharing solutions in C and Python. Thanks to him, C is the new language introduced to us. I would also like to thank him for taking Python contributions closer to the magic number.
Andrew Shitov joined the gang and shared his first C++. Apart from Andrew, we have few others contributors who also contributed in C++, i.</description>

      <description>HEADLINE The Task #1 of Perl Weekly Challenge - 069 raised a very interesting question i.e. is 1 strobogrammatic number? So far, I got mixed response some says yes and some not. My first thought was Yes, it is but later changed my mind. It is controversial and I don&amp;rsquo;t want loose the focus on the task itself. Please remember the objective is to have fun and not to get into controversial domain.</description>

      <description>HEADLINES  With three members joining Team PWC, we now have 173 members. I welcome all of them with open arms. I would like to mention one member explicitly Myoungjin Jeon, why? He is someone who did Perl long time ago and currently a Chef by profession. What impressed me the most about him is that he never let his love for Perl die. I hope he finds the weekly challenge interesting to keep him going.</description>

      <description>HEADLINES  Two of the three members who joined the Team PWC last week, shared solutions to the &amp;ldquo;Perl Weekly Challenge - 068&amp;rdquo;. When I requested them for a brief introduction, most of them came back with Perl background. But then Myoungjin Jeon surprised me with solutions in Raku as well. I came across one of his blog where he mentioned about his work on creating combinations in Perl in the year 2013.</description>

      <description>HEADLINE The Week #068 is my 23rd week in a row participating the weekly challenge. For the first time, I created a package to deal with the &amp;ldquo;Reorder List&amp;rdquo; task. It really helped me in thinking straight when dealing with linked list. With the help my favourite CPAN module Moo, creating class is like piece of cake as shown below.
package Node; use Moo; has v =&amp;gt; (is =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;rw&amp;#39;); has c =&amp;gt; (is =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;rw&amp;#39;); sub show_link { my ($self) = @_; my $head = $self; my @v = (); while ($head-&amp;gt;c) { push @v, $head-&amp;gt;v; $head = $head-&amp;gt;c; } push @v, $head-&amp;gt;v; return sprintf(&amp;#34;%s&amp;#34;, join &amp;#39; -&amp;gt; &amp;#39;, @v); } I will talk more in detail later down below.</description>

With great pleasure, we announce the Champion of last month, Mark Anderson, currently ranked #027 with score of 122. He joined the Team PWC in the Week #018. As of today, he has contributed Perl (19) and Raku (42).
After a long gap, we have Perl and Raku reviews together in one week.</description>

      <description>HEADLINE This week both tasks had one thing in common i.e. pairing two or more list. In the past, I have taken the help from CPAN module Algorithm::Combinatorics for such tasks. However this time, I wanted to get my hand dirty and came up with the following:
# generate all possible combinations my @combinations = (&amp;#39;&amp;#39;); foreach my $members (@data) { @combinations = map { my $member = $_; map $member.</description>

      <description>HEADLINE The much awaited event, **Conference in the Cloud&amp;rdquo; took most of my free time. Having said that I still managed to do Live Coding YouTube videosfor Divide Integers and Power Integers.
I really enjoyed both tasks, specially Power Integers. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long to solve both tasks. I was able to get it done by midweek. But for YouTube video, I had to wait until the conference was over. Thanks to the Chief Editor of Perl Weekly newletter editorial note, I now have 67 subscribers to my YouTube Channel.</description>

It was nice to see so many familiar names from Team PWC in the audience. Among many talks, I was really happy to watch Damian Conway live for the first time.

      <description>HEADLINES  Welcome back Walt Mankowski and thanks for sharing your contributions. Also thanks for sharing Python solutions.
Thanks Andrew Shitov solving past challenges and blogging about it as well.
Python is the most popular language among the Team PWC after Perl and Raku. We now have 10 contributors for Python.
1) Lubos Kolouch: Python (25). 2) User Person: Python (21). 3) Orestis Zekai: Python (16). 4) Burkhard Nickels: Python (8).</description>

      <description>HEADLINES  The week #065 started on a happy note when I received the contribution by Andrew Shitov. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t need an introduction, does he? He even blogged about his contribution. On a serious note, I got the sense that most of the Team PWC found the task Palindrome Partition very confusing. I must admit, I also realised when I solved the task myself. I noticed there are more solutions than what I thought initially.</description>

      <description>HEADLINE Having missed the blog last week, I wanted to make sure it doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen again. I did catch up the last week blog this week. How did I get time this week around? Well, I delayed Live Coding session for Perl and Raku until Sunday.
As of now, I have done 2 videos, one each for both tasks in Perl. I am planning to do one more later in the evening in Raku just for &amp;ldquo;Digits Sum&amp;rdquo; task.</description>

I have been hooked into YouTube video of live coding by Richard Park. It was Richard who first started sharing his YouTube video of live coding.</description>

      <description>HEADLINES  Not sure about others but I have noticed E. Choroba is on a mission to improve his past solutions.
Square with 5 distinct digits Invert Tree Find Numbers Nothing comes FREE, the above improvements is keeping E. Choroba too busy to do weekly blog. We are missing them very badly. Hopefully it will start again very soon.
Do you remember, Jaldhar H. Vyas? He was missing from the scene for sometime but he is back in action now, back to back 2 weeks.</description>

      <description>HEADLINES  Two recent tragedies really upset me the most, first the killing of George Floyd and second the killing of pregnant elephant in India. All Life Matters, including Black. I try to keep my political views to select few and avoid sharing on social media. I hope I am not crossing the lines here.
The Week #062 was the dullest week ever earlier but thanks to all Team PWC members, it is no longer the least contributions week.</description>

      <description>HEADLINES  Welcome back Jaldhar H. Vyas, we missed you.
For the first time ever, I noticed E. Choroba missed a week i.e #062. However, he made it up and shared the solution to the Sort Email Addresses. To my surprise, he even updated his solution to the task Longest Common Substring of Perl Weekly Challenge - 018. It shows his commitment to continuous improvement.
Thanks to Richard Park contributions, the solutions in APL (18) is moving up in the rank #003, only behind Python (87) and C++ (22).</description>

      <description>HEADLINE After the most difficult week (Week #062), it was very satisfying. I found both the tasks this week (Week #063) fun and challenging. The best part was that I could do both tasks in an hour, which is rare. I liked the &amp;ldquo;Rotate String&amp;rdquo; task very much. Thanks to Ryan, we already had test cases handy for the &amp;ldquo;Last Word&amp;rdquo; task. I will talk about each in detail down below.</description>

      <description>HEADLINE  Once again, Neil Bowers, came up with another exciting task for all Team PWC members. Like always, it was fun task. Thanks to Ryan for providng sample data and expected result based on the definition of the task. Half the job done already. The only thing left for the us, is get on with the job. I noticed Raku needed slightly different approach then the Perl. It could be I am doing something very badly.</description>

      <description>HEADLINES  Happy Idd to all Team PWC members.
It was the first Idd celebration when we couldn&amp;rsquo;t go to the mosque for special prayer. Life is no longer same even after so many weeks on lockdown. It appears we have to start adjusting to the new rules.
From next week, I will have new routine to follow as Ramadan is over. Working hours is going to be back to normal.</description>

      <description>HEADLINES  We all know, Perl Weekly Challenge, primarily focus on Perl and Raku. However, in recent weeks, I noticed Team PWC members actively sharing solutions in other guest languages. As of today, we have received solutions in 16 guest languages, Python being the most popular language. There is still scope for more guest languages. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t tried anything so far then why not give it a try.
Newly joined member Sangeet Kar shared his first Python solutions.</description>

      <description>HEADLINE At first, I thought Product SubArray is easy task. Therefore I went public categorised as Task #1. My definition of easy task is you just start coding without doing any ground work. However when I started coding, I had to take a pause and do processing in my head befoore coding. So then as per my definition, Product SubArray no longer consider as an easy task. After finishing the task in no time once I understood the flow, it turned out to be clean solution.</description>

If you remember, I wrote a blog when we completed 3 months of weekly challenge. Then again when we completed 6 months. So why no celebration at the end of first anniversary? Certainly it was the biggest moments for all of us associated with Perl Weekly Challenge or rather The Weekly Challenge.</description>

      <description>HEADLINE I am not sure about you guys but I found writing blog is very nice feeling. I get nice ideas to clean up the code. This week, I even found a bug that even unit test couldn&amp;rsquo;t catch. I would rather not share it, quite embarassing. The bug was in my Perl solutions to the &amp;ldquo;Find Numbers&amp;rdquo; task. My git commit tree might disclose it, if you really want to know.</description>

I noticed Team PWC members making constant noise, in a positive way, with regular blogs. To me personally, by reading blog, you not only get the story behind each solutions but the also the journey itself. Keep blogging and sharing knowledge.
I would like to thank Team PWC member Richard Park for introducing the amazing language APL.</description>

We welcome all of them and hope they would have as much fun as we have had so far. I would like to mention one thing about Max Kossek, in his first week itself, he solved past four weeks solutions. Great attempt. Keep it up, Max.
Another pleasant surprise from last week was, one of the earliest member of the team, Colin Crain started blogging about his work.</description>

      <description>HEADLINE This week, I changed the format of my weekly blog slightly. Why? Well, I wanted to keep the Perl and Raku solutions next to each other so that it is easier for reader (me, mostly) to see the difference. It gives me immense pleasure to see the end result when I am done translating Perl solutions into Raku. It looks lot cleaner and precise. The only thing it is behind is performance when I do comparison.</description>

      <description>HEADLINE This week, I struggled with both the task, to be honest. Dealing with alpha part of the version was really pain in the neck. Every time, I struggle with any task, I follow the college days course of action i.e. pick a pend and paper. I start dribbling the thought process, it really helps in getting the idea out on the paper. Once the rough draft is ready, it is time to face the unit test trial.</description>

      <description>HEADLINE Of the two tasks, my favourite was Shortest Unique Prefix. I must confess I have never done this before. It was fun solving though. I enjoyed it thoroughly. As always, Raku solution looks more elegant, in my hunble opinion. With every passing week, I learn something new in Raku and get to practice what I learnt so far. The weekly challenge is giving me an opportunity to explore the nitty gritty of Raku.</description>

      <description>HEADLINES  Last week, we had the opportunity to speak to the Perl Weekly Champion of last month, Alicia Bielsa. I would like to share the relationship between Perl Weekly Challenge and Perl Weekly Newsletter. I have been associated with Perl Weekly Newsletter since May 2018 as Co-Editor. The name Perl Weekly Challenge was naturally inspired by the Perl Weekly Newsletter. The Chief Editor, Gabor Szabo has been a big supporter of Perl Weekly Challenge.</description>

I noticed, Roger Bell_West is on the loose. He has been getting the blogs of past challenge done. Last week we had blogs for Perl Weekly Challenge - 052 and Perl Weekly Challenge - 053.</description>

      <description>Before I say anything about my contributions, I would like to share my sweet encounter with Raku. Last week while working on the task Flip Binary using Raku, I was struggling to figure out all the binary strings with maximum 1s. I had the results in a Hash where key was the binary string and value was the total count of 1s in it. The idea was to sort the Hash by values first then sort by keys.</description>

      <description>The Perl Weekly Challenge - 055 was the most difficult week for me ever since I started contributing. Usually I submit my Perl and Raku by Wednesday but this time, I was working overtime and could only finished by Sunday afternoon. I must confess that I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise it was going to be as this difficult when I came up with the challenge. I am happy that I did it at the end of the day.</description>

      <description>HELP: How to contribute?   Just submit Pull Request to GitHub repository with your solutions. First find out the latest challenge folder, more likely the highest numbered folder is the latest challenge folder e.g. challenge-002. If you are an existing member, you would probably find a folder by your name. For example, if your name is &amp;ldquo;Joe Blog&amp;rdquo; then there would be a folder called &amp;ldquo;joe-blog&amp;rdquo;. Under your named folder, you would find a file README.</description>

      <description>For the first time, since I started participating the weekly challenges, I thought of doing one-liner. With handy CPAN modules, it was pretty straight forward in Perl. Even Raku with built-in features wasn&amp;rsquo;t far behind Perl. Like in the past, I learn something new in Raku every week. This week was no different. I will share what I learnt this time later.
  PERL   Task #1: kth Permutation Sequence The CPAN module Algorithm::Combinatorics is becoming very popular and favourite among Perl Hackers.</description>

      <description>Raku Solutions Weekly Review  Task #1: Stepping Numbers  Before going into the subject, I should apologize for having suspended my reviews of the Perl Weekly Challenge submissions for about two and a half months. I had warned Mohammad Anwar about that and told him the reasons, but Mohammad did not make these reasons public. The reason is that I did not have time during that period, because I had a lot of work running a local electoral campaign.</description>

      <description>I noticed now a days, I go for solution with unit test. I will give the credit to fellow Team PWC member, E. Choroba. It feels great when you see the test pass at the end. Well the solution looks little different than just standalone solution. For that reason, I decided to do both for Raku solutions. Also this allowed me to explore unit testing in Raku.

I have known him for many years, mostly got to attend his talk at London Perl Workshop. I still remember his talk &amp;ldquo;The Art of Programming&amp;rdquo;. It was a very different experience where audience got to play with piece of paper during the entire talk.

      <description>I am really enjoying the weekly challenges, specially doing in Raku. The point of blogging is also about sharing my fight with Raku. I hardly write anything about my Perl solution as I don&amp;rsquo;t see anything new to talk about. Having said that, I still go for Perl first as it is my first love and will remain so rest of my life. Even today, my brain is so tuned to Perl, every ideas come in form and shape of Perl only.</description>

      <description>I had great fun working with Merge Intervals task this week. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it was going to be more harder to solve than Noble number task. Keeping in mind the sample data provided with the task, I came up with solution very quickly. I was very happy with the result.
I then decided to share it on Twitter. Guess what happens next? The master of Unit Test, none other than E.</description>

      <description>This is my second blog for The Weekly Challenge. I am only able to participate, thanks to Ryan Thompson for helping me with the Perl and Raku reviews. I am going for Perl solutions first then will try to translate it into Raku next. I believe in coding to learn the language. With so many Raku experts around, I am not shy throwing questions up. I am now going to share my experience doing &amp;ldquo;The Weekly Challenge - 049&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>HEADLINES   We are pleased to announce that we have found Raku Reviewer to cover the temporary break by Laurent Rosenfeld. Any guess? He is the coolest kid in the team, Ryan Thompson. I would like to mention another gem from the team, Ulrich Rieke, who is a star contributor. He has been contributing regularly in Perl, Raku, C++ and Haskell.
You must have noticed there is a fixed set of members who blog about their solutions every week.</description>

I know it is NOT an easy task and that too doing both. Hats off to Ryan for accepting the challenge. Team members have already appreciated his quality reviews. Please do share your suggestions.
I also noticed familiar faces back in action.</description>

For the first time last week, I noticed he contributed Perl solutions. In the past, I have seen Perl contributors started contributing Raku solutions but the reversal never happend before. This is the proudest moment for me. Thanks Arne Sommer for your continuous support and encouragement.</description>

I made quick arrangement and flew to India last Friday. I met my Dad the next day at the hospital. It was an emotional re-union of Father &amp;amp; Son. I am planning to stay with him for a week and flying back coming Sunday.</description>

      <description>I had been planning to kick start the mini project of renaming Perl6 to Raku on the official website of &amp;ldquo;Perl Weekly Challenge&amp;rdquo;. And the side project to this, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be called &amp;ldquo;The Weekly Challenge - Perl &amp;amp; Raku&amp;rdquo;? This is sticky area and needed more time to go through various aspects. Renaming project wasn&amp;rsquo;t too difficult to deal with but I was looking for some FREE time to do it properly.</description>

Write a script that can convert numbers to and from a base35 representation, using the characters 0-9 and A-Y.  I cannot do it as a one-liner this time, but it was still fun. While trying to solve it I realized that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be much harder to implement a general solution to convert from any base to any base between 2 and 36.</description>

 The gift is presented by Laurent Rosenfeld. Today he is talking about his solutions to Task #2: Word Ladder** of &amp;ldquo;The Weekly Challenge - 007&amp;rdquo;**.
 Given two input words and a file that contains an ordered word list, implement a routine that finds the shortest ladder between the two input words. For example, for the words cold and warm, the routine might return: (&amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;cord&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;core&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;care&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;card&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;ward&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;warm&amp;rdquo;)</description>

      <description>HEADLINES   Last week, Yet Ebreo, joined the Perl Weekly Challenge like any other team members. However I noticed something special about him. He appeared to be very enthusiasts. In the very first week, He submitted solutions in Perl5 and Perl6. Well he didn&amp;rsquo;t stop there, he even blogged about it. Did he stop there? Well not, he started solving all the past challenges. In the series, he started with Perl Weekly Challenge - 001, [P5 #1], [P5 #2], [P6 #1] and [P6 #2].</description>

For a quick overview, go through the original tasks and recap of the weekly challenge.
 Task #1  CPAN modules used: bignum, Carp, Const::Fast, Getopt::Long, Math::AnyNum, Math::Big, Math::BigFloat, Math::Big, Math::BigRat, Math::NumberCruncher, Math::Symbolic, Modern::Perl, Sidef, Test::More and Text::Table::Tiny.
The biggest takeaway for this task was the solution by Randy Lauen where he did a comparison of different CPAN modules against the formulated calculation.</description>

For a quick overview, go through the original tasks and recap of the weekly challenge.
We&amp;rsquo;re going to review thing a bit differently for this week by listing down all the CPAN modules used for a particular task. The modules usage reflects three things, the coding style of a participant (Function::Parameters) the common used module (Math::Prime::Util) to solve a particular problem, and the trend of module usage (Modern::Perl) which was seen quite often in the last few challenges.</description>

      <description>HEADLINES   Last week, we had a guest contributor, Orestis Zekai, works as a Software Engineer. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t know Perl but fluent in Python. He came across earlier weekly challenges and found it fun. So he decided to solve the Perl Weekly Challenge - 018 using Python language, Task #1 and Task #2. He wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be part of weekly competition, though.
Last but not the least, keep contributing to the weekly challenge, making sure we keep the focus on Fun and Knowledge Sharing.</description>

We have had maximum number of new members joining last week. We now have 100 active members in the team. By the time, you are reading this, we have already declared our second winner.</description>

      <description>We are now 3 months old and growing fast every week with the support of wider Perl Community.
The prime motto of the &amp;ldquo;Perl Weekly Challenge&amp;rdquo; is to promote Perl (be it Perl5 or Perl6). I was looking for fun way of doing it. Being, co-editor of Perl Weekly newsletter, I noticed that not many people blog about interesting use of the language. I must say, Perl6 community is doing far better than Perl5.</description>

      <description>This week, Joelle Maslak sent us the first solution in Perl6 as Pull Request [#265]. Then came Scimon Proctor, again in Perl6 as Pull Request [#266]. Kevin Colyer submitted the next in Perl6 as Github gist. By now, I started thinking where are all #Perl5 hackers. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to wait longer, Pete Houston sent us the solution in Perl5 by email. Finally we had our first complete solution in Perl5 by Dave Jacoby as Pull Request [#271].</description>

For a quick overview, read through all questions and recap of the challenge first.
This week was quite unique as we observed there were several submissions where submissions were based on existing solutions but were done in a more alternative and elegant way. Moreover, some of these show case the expressiveness of Perl programming language itself, which is also one of the key goal of this weekly challenge.</description>

It is now time to annouce the surprise. Few weeks ago, Peter Sergeant of PerlCareers contacted me by email and offered to sponsor the weekly challenge to make it more attractive. He offered the winner of weekly challenge $50 Amazon Voucher. We, Peter and I, worked out the formalities and other related issues. All registered members who contribute to the weekly challenge for the week will go into the ballot box.</description>

      <description>I was little late in releasing the weekly challenge last time. If I remember correctly it was around 4am Monday morning. Still, by 9am (UK time), I had first solution as PR by none other than the Scimon Procotor himself. And within the next hour, he submitted the solution to the second challenge. By lunch time, I had one more member Ozzy submitted solution to the first challenge.
This week, Joelle Maslak joined 100+ score club and became the second member.</description>

For those who are new to the weekly review post, the main purpose of weekly review is to document down interesting approaches of using Perl programming language to solve each week challenges. Code reading or review allows us to learn / relearn, discover / rediscover, and appreciate / reappreciate (some participants uses other programming languages in their day job) new, interesting, and quirky things accomplished with Perl (unfortunately Perl 5 for now).</description>

 Challenge #1  The Wikipage page have a good introduction and manual calculation of conversion of Arabic numerals to Roman numerals. Read Laurent Rosenfeld&amp;rsquo;s blog post for the finer implementation details.
Most participants uses a hash to map between Arabic and Roman numerals. Since order of the matching roman numerals against the Arabic values is important, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to sort it before any conversion.</description>

My first encounter with him was when I bought his book Perl Best Practices. I have been a big fan of him since then. Checkout his blog. I would also like to mention another newly joined member Yozen Hernandez. He blogged first time ever that too about his solution to the Perl Weekly Challenge.</description>

Checkout her last review if you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen already. Ever since I started reviewing the challenges, I am looking for volunteer to do the same for Perl 6. I know it is weekly commitment and can be tiresome. If we can create team of reviewers for each languages then it would be even more fun.</description>

      <description>I would like to talk about blog written by some members this week. In the past, I went into the details of Perl 5 solutions mainly. Lets change the trend this time.
Following blogs have been reported last week. Each blog is a text book in itself as it teaches you so many things. I enjoyed reading each and every blog. Please do read them when you get time.

      <description>The best part of the Perl Weekly Challenge is reading the blog by the members. Personally, I like the journey of an idea to final solution. If you look at closely all the blogs, every member has unique style. They all think differently but ends up with the same result. I have become fan of few in the last few weeks. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, reading code is fascinating but boring.</description>

      <description>For the first time ever, I published RECAP blog before the weekly challenge. It is the sign that things are settling down. Members are using Pull Request more frequently to submit the solutions. Last Sunday, when I made the Challenge 004 public, I couple of people responded in no time.
The first person was Kivanc Yazan and he announced it on Twitter.
The next person followed him was @smokemachine. He has been regular since last week.</description>

      <description>I noticed last week, less participation than the previous week. Why? Honestly speaking I have no clue. Could it be the questions were too tricky for the challenge? The week before, I received the feedback that the questions were too easy and simple. So I went for little trickier one this time. It seems that I have to balance it somehow.
I am gratefull to all members submitting the solutions as Pull Request.</description>

      <description>Every week, I release the challenge by email first and then on Twitter. I wait for about 30 minutes to get the first response to the challenge. I also look at the Google Analytics Realtime Chart to see how many users are reading the new challenge page and from which part of the world.
Last week, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to wait long, I saw the first reaction on Twitter from Khalid.</description>

      <description>As received in response to the challenge by Philippe Bruhat. Highly recommended.
 Write a script or one-liner to remove leading zeros from positive numbers.
 As a filter:
perl -ple &#39;s/^0+//&#39;  Challenge #2  Write a script that can convert numbers to and from a base35 representation, using the characters 0-9 and A-Y.
 Those who remember The Perl Review Code golf contest may remember this challenge.
In February 2002, brian d foy wanted to try his hand at publishing a Perl magazine (following the demise of The Perl Journal).</description>

      <description>I noticed the timing of releasing the weekly challenge is not helping anyone in UK timezone as I released around mid-night. So if somebody who lives in other side where it is day they get to try the challenge first. I realised within few hours of making the challenge public, I starts getting feedback but none from UK member. It is only when it is Monday morning, I see reactions from them.</description>

      <description>Last week challenge turned out to be a cakewalk for Perl 6 hackers. This shows my lack of knowledge of Perl 6. I have requested our inhouse Perl 6 experts to share some challenging questions. I already received few and kept in the challenge bank. I will use it in the coming weeks. Credit will be given to the hacker when published. We highly recommend that you submit you solutions as PR to the repository.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the first weekly recap of &amp;ldquo;Perl Weekly Challenge&amp;rdquo;.
Apology for the delay, I was supposed to release this blog with the second challenge of the series. I promise next blog is going to be on time.
For the first time ever, the Monday 25th March 2019, was not depressing like any other Monday. Thanks to &amp;ldquo;Perl Weekly Challenge&amp;rdquo;, I was so busy following public reactions on Twitter. It was a memorable experience.</description>

The challenge reads as follows:
Write a script that computes the first five perfect numbers. A perfect number is an integer that is the sum of its positive proper divisors (all divisors except itself).</description>
