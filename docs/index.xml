      <description>After so many years, I finally got around to contribute to Perl Advent Calendar 2022. For me personally, it is an honour to be part of it. I have contributed in the past so I am aware of its reach. I grab the opportunity every time I get the offer.
This time around, Olaf Alders, is leading the team and managing the Perl Advent Calendar 2022. As always the case, this year also the calendar is full of interesting topics to keep you busy in this holiday season.</description>

      <description>Raku and I: Journey begin &amp;hellip;  It has been ages since I last blogged about Raku. The only time, I have blogged about when I took part in The Weekly Challenge. But then this also changed recently as I finally found time to contribute to the weekly fun challenges but no blogging still.
I would say it is all about my mental state, since I have so much to talk about.</description>
