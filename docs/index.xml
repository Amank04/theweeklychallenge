      <description>Get to know about Packy Anderson Welcome to the monthly series Meet The Champion.
Last month we declared Robbie Hatley, the winner of September 2023.
Today we are talking to Packy Anderson, the winner of October 2023 of The Weekly Challenge. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.
 Mohammad: Tell us about your technical background?
Packy: My mother learned how to code in the Navy flipping bits on the console of a UNIVAC (and wrote some of the code in NTDS) and her father had been a systems analyst for ConEdison, so the last thing I wanted to do was work with computers.</description>
