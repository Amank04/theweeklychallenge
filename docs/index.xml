      <description>This is actually as we received in response to the challenge by Philippe Bruhat. Highly recommended.
Challenge #1 Write a script to replace the character ‘e’ with ‘E’ in the string ‘Perl Weekly Challenge’. Also print the number of times the character ‘e’ found in the string.
 $ perl -E &#39;$_=shift;say y/e/E/;say&#39; &#39;Perl Weekly Challenge&#39; 5 PErl WEEkly ChallEngE  Historical note: y///c is called &amp;ldquo;Abigail&amp;rsquo;s length horror&amp;rdquo; by golfers and obfuscators (couldn&amp;rsquo;t trace where the term came from).</description>

      <description>Welcome to the first task of the &amp;ldquo;Perl Weekly Challenge&amp;rdquo; event. Every Monday, we are going to propose 2 challenges, one aimed at Beginners and another for Experts. However you are free to choose the challenge you fancy. You can even attempt to solve both. As you know the choice of languages are Perl5 and Perl6. You can solve one challenge in Perl5 and other in Perl6, if you like.</description>
