<description> Welcome to the first challenge of &#x201C;Perl Weekly Challenge&#x201D; event. As promised, we would start with simple one and gradually move on difficult challenges. I am thinking for having 2 challenges every week, one for beginners and another for experienced members. What do you think? Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Quas alias ut totam labore, rerum soluta harum vitae pariatur, optio, ad dolore, nihil eligendi nesciunt repellat esse provident sapiente. </description>

<title>Perl Weekly Challenge - 005</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-005/</link>
<description>The best part of the Perl Weekly Challenge is reading the blog by the members. Personally, I like the journey of an idea to final solution. If you look at closely all the blogs, every member has unique style. They all think differently but ends up with the same result. I have become fan of few in the last few weeks. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, reading code is fascinating but boring. If you read the story behind each approach is amazingly blockbuster.</description>

<description>I came to know about one secret player of Perl Weekly Challenge just few days ago. Any guesses? He is the Damian Conway. He doesn&#x2019;t need any introduction. My first encounter with him was when I bought his book Perl Best Practices. I have been a big fan of him since then. Checkout his blog. I would also like to mention another newly joined member Yozen Hernandez. He blogged first time ever that too about his solution to the Perl Weekly Challenge. In his blog he wrote something very nice and sweet at the end.</description>

<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/recap-challenge-009/</link>
<description>I would like to this opportunity to thank one of the respected member Kian-Meng Ang for the help in reviewing Perl 5 challenges every week. Checkout her last review if you haven&#x2019;t seen already. Ever since I started reviewing the challenges, I am looking for volunteer to do the same for Perl 6. I know it is weekly commitment and can be tiresome. If we can create team of reviewers for each languages then it would be even more fun. I feel guilty every week not talking about Perl 6 magical solutions.</description>

<title>RECAP - Perl Weekly Challenge - 002</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/recap-challenge-002/</link>
<description>I noticed the timing of releasing the weekly challenge is not helping anyone in UK timezone as I released around mid-night. So if somebody who lives in other side where it is day they get to try the challenge first. I realised within few hours of making the challenge public, I starts getting feedback but none from UK member. It is only when it is Monday morning, I see reactions from them. I am not saying anything wrong in this. Just sharing my point of view. I remember during the launch week, Simon Proctor nailed it with lightning fast response. However in the second week, Joelle Maslak was really quick and beat Simon Proctor. I got confused when I announced Simon Proctor was the first person to submit the solution. Simon correctly pointed out to me that Joelle Maslak actually did it before him.</description>

<description>Last week, Yet Ebreo, joined the Perl Weekly Challenge like any other team members. However I noticed something special about him. He appeared to be very enthusiasts. In the very first week, He submitted solutions in Perl5 and Perl6. Well he didn&#x2019;t stop there, he even blogged about it. Did he stop there? Well not, he started solving all the past challenges. In the series, he started with Perl Weekly Challenge - 001, [P5 #1], [P5 #2], [P6 #1] and [P6 #2]. I am really impressed. I wish him good luck.</description>

This time, Adam Russell also joined the group for API task this week.</description>

<title>Perl Weekly Challenge - 003</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-003/</link>
<description>Last week challenge turned out to be a cakewalk for Perl 6 hackers. This shows my lack of knowledge of Perl 6. I have requested our inhouse Perl 6 experts to share some challenging questions. I already received few and kept in the challenge bank. I will use it in the coming weeks. Credit will be given to the hacker when published. We highly recommend that you submit you solutions as PR to the repository. If you need help with regard to submitting Pull Request, there is handy guide. A gentle reminder, please don&#x2019;t try to golf your solution. We are looking for unique way to solve the problem. Last week, newly joined member even submit test script, which is handy but not required. Also please mention any prereqs to execute the solution i.e. version of Perl5 or Perl6. Please add meaningful comment to your code, in case anyone (most likely me) reading your code. Avoid using external library as much as possible. Try to get the solution straight out of the language. We encourage you to blog about your solution, focus on how you achieve the result. If you do blog then please share with us.</description>

<description>I noticed last week, less participation than the previous week. Why? Honestly speaking I have no clue. Could it be the questions were too tricky for the challenge? The week before, I received the feedback that the questions were too easy and simple. So I went for little trickier one this time. It seems that I have to balance it somehow.</description>

<title>About Us</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/about/</link>
<description> We are a bunch of Perl 5 and Perl 6 hackers. The main purpose behind this project is to learn something new from each other. The most important thing is to have fun. We will try to keep it simple and easy for anyone to join us. The main point is that you don&#x27;t need to be an expert in the language. Even if you are new to the language, you will find some easy challenges to start with. Take me for example, I have recently started learning Perl 6 and I will be taking on easy challenges to test my knowledge and learn new stuff. Feel free to ask any questions with regard to the choice of your language. And if you are an expert in the language then please take on a newbie and give a helping hand.  NOTE: The photo above is not us but it came with the theme, so we are using it. </description>

<title>Perl Weekly Challenge - Perl5 &#x26; Perl6</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/</link>
<description>Let me share my journey of getting into computing. It all started in the year 1993, I just joined the 3 year degree course of B.Sc (Math Honours). It was during the first year, I realised doing just degree is not going to help me secure a job that I needed desparately to support my family. A friend of mine asked me if I am interested to join computer training course. Without giving any thought, I decided to join him and went to a local branch of APTECH, a well known name in computer training institute in India. When we reached their office and enquired about various courses they were offerings. We were told to give an aptitute test before we can join any course. I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the test but decided to give it a try. We both secured over 90% mark in the test. My friend was fully prepared, so he started dicussing about the courses. At the end he decided to join one year course in &#x22;Diploma In Information and System Management&#x22; (DISM). At the time, the fee was INR 13,000. But I didn&#x27;t have the money to join the course. I told my mother about it. Like any mother, she decided to sell her wedding jewellery to pay my fees. It was important for me to start earning asap. I was hoping this course would help me land a decent job. I joined the course 6 months later. On the very first day of course, I noticed the same friend is my course faculty. He was a bright student, therefore APTECH offered him the job while he was still doing his course there. We were taught Foxpro and COBOL programming language as a part of the course. At the end of the course, I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the knowledge I had. So I decided to learn few other programming languages. The trouble was, I didn&#x27;t have PC/Laptop to practice and also not enough money to buy computer books. I joined a local library called &#x22;Muslim Library&#x22; as it was FREE and started borrowing books from there. The library was very far from where I lived. I had to take 2 bus journeys to get there. Sometimes, I didn&#x27;t even have enough money to pay the bus fare. My older sister, who used to give home tution, always helped me. I learnt Pascal by just reading books. Then I learnt &#x22;C&#x22; but this time, I found out one of my friend is running computer training institute. So I went to him and asked if I can use his PC when ever it is available. In return I would teach his students. He kindly accepted my offer. While I was still exploring &#x22;C&#x22; language, I saw an advert about a multinational computer training center opening in Jamshedpur called INFOTECH. I decided to apply for the post of Faculty. But I only got the job of &#x22;Lab Assistant&#x22; for INR 2000 per month. For me that was a lot of money as I could support my family, specially my younger brother who was still in college. There was an added advantage being a Lab Assistant, I could have as much PC time as I like. I learnt Oracle during my time there and got promoted to Faculty after one year.</description>

If you could send us a recent photo to show on the team page then that would be great, but it isn&#x27;t required.</description>
