This time, Adam Russell also joined the group for API task this week.</description>

<description>Last week had been the toughest week for me. My dad is now back home and doing well. Thanks each and every person for the best wishes. I know everything is messed up at the moment. I came back from India with throat infection and really bad cough. I am not fully recovered yet but still improving day-by-day. I would like to thank Ryan Thompson for doing Perl Review in my absence. There is going to be a short pause on Raku review, please bear with us, unless someone from the team volunteer to take this challenge for a short period.</description>

<title>RECAP - Perl Weekly Challenge - 002</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/recap-challenge-002/</link>
<description>I noticed the timing of releasing the weekly challenge is not helping anyone in UK timezone as I released around mid-night. So if somebody who lives in other side where it is day they get to try the challenge first. I realised within few hours of making the challenge public, I starts getting feedback but none from UK member. It is only when it is Monday morning, I see reactions from them. I am not saying anything wrong in this. Just sharing my point of view. I remember during the launch week, Simon Proctor nailed it with lightning fast response. However in the second week, Joelle Maslak was really quick and beat Simon Proctor. I got confused when I announced Simon Proctor was the first person to submit the solution. Simon correctly pointed out to me that Joelle Maslak actually did it before him.</description>

<description>Today, Monday 25th Nov, 2019, we have completed 8 months of successfull run of The Weekly Challenge. Over the period, I came across many smart hackers. I have lots of personal favourites that I always look forward to their solutions. It always brings a big smile on my face every time I look at their solutions. Sometimes, I find it difficult to grasp in first reading. But then once it settles down, the feeling is out of this world.</description>

<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-004/</link>
<description>I noticed last week, less participation than the previous week. Why? Honestly speaking I have no clue. Could it be the questions were too tricky for the challenge? The week before, I received the feedback that the questions were too easy and simple. So I went for little trickier one this time. It seems that I have to balance it somehow.</description>

<title>The Weekly Challenge - Perl &#x26; Raku</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/</link>
<description>Let me share my journey of getting into computing. It all started in the year 1993, I just joined the 3 year degree course of B.Sc (Math Honours). It was during the first year, I realised doing just degree is not going to help me secure a job that I needed desparately to support my family. A friend of mine asked me if I am interested to join computer training course. Without giving any thought, I decided to join him and went to a local branch of APTECH, a well known name in computer training institute in India. When we reached their office and enquired about various courses they were offerings. We were told to give an aptitute test before we can join any course. I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the test but decided to give it a try. We both secured over 90% mark in the test. My friend was fully prepared, so he started dicussing about the courses. At the end he decided to join one year course in &#x22;Diploma In Information and System Management&#x22; (DISM). At the time, the fee was INR 13,000. But I didn&#x27;t have the money to join the course. I told my mother about it. Like any mother, she decided to sell her wedding jewellery to pay my fees. It was important for me to start earning asap. I was hoping this course would help me land a decent job. I joined the course 6 months later. On the very first day of course, I noticed the same friend is my course faculty. He was a bright student, therefore APTECH offered him the job while he was still doing his course there. We were taught Foxpro and COBOL programming language as a part of the course. At the end of the course, I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the knowledge I had. So I decided to learn few other programming languages. The trouble was, I didn&#x27;t have PC/Laptop to practice and also not enough money to buy computer books. I joined a local library called &#x22;Muslim Library&#x22; as it was FREE and started borrowing books from there. The library was very far from where I lived. I had to take 2 bus journeys to get there. Sometimes, I didn&#x27;t even have enough money to pay the bus fare. My older sister, who used to give home tution, always helped me. I learnt Pascal by just reading books. Then I learnt &#x22;C&#x22; but this time, I found out one of my friend is running computer training institute. So I went to him and asked if I can use his PC when ever it is available. In return I would teach his students. He kindly accepted my offer. While I was still exploring &#x22;C&#x22; language, I saw an advert about a multinational computer training center opening in Jamshedpur called INFOTECH. I decided to apply for the post of Faculty. But I only got the job of &#x22;Lab Assistant&#x22; for INR 2000 per month. For me that was a lot of money as I could support my family, specially my younger brother who was still in college. There was an added advantage being a Lab Assistant, I could have as much PC time as I like. I learnt Oracle during my time there and got promoted to Faculty after one year.</description>

<description>Every week, I release the challenge by email first and then on Twitter. I wait for about 30 minutes to get the first response to the challenge. I also look at the Google Analytics Realtime Chart to see how many users are reading the new challenge page and from which part of the world.</description>

<description> HEADLINES We are pleased to announce that we have found Raku Reviewer to cover the temporary break by Laurent Rosenfeld. Any guess? He is the coolest kid in the team, Ryan Thompson. I would like to mention another gem from the team, Ulrich Rieke, who is a star contributor. He has been contributing regularly in Perl, Raku, C++ and Haskell. You must have noticed there is a fixed set of members who blog about their solutions every week. </description>

<title>HELP: How to contribute?</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/how-to-contribute/</link>
<description>First find out the latest challenge folder, more likely the highest numbered folder is the latest challenge folder e.g. challenge-002. If you are an existing member, you would probably find a folder by your name. For example, if your name is &#x201C;Joe Blog&#x201D; then there would be a folder called &#x201C;joe-blog&#x201D;. Under your named folder, you would find a file README. Depending on your choice of language, you should create a folder here e.g. perl for Perl and raku for Raku. Please keep everything lowercase. Inside each of these folders you can save your solutions. If it is perl script for Task #1 then call it ch-1.pl. Similarly if it is perl script for Task #2 then call it ch-2.pl. For Raku solutions, call it ch-1.p6 and ch-2.p6 respectively. And if you are writing one-liner then call it ch-1.sh or ch-2.sh. If you are contributing for the first time, please create your named folder as described above. Also let us know what name you would like us to use?</description>

<title>About Us</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/about/</link>
<description> We are a bunch of Perl 5 and Perl 6 hackers. The main purpose behind this project is to learn something new from each other. The most important thing is to have fun. We will try to keep it simple and easy for anyone to join us. The main point is that you don&#x27;t need to be an expert in the language. Even if you are new to the language, you will find some easy challenges to start with. Take me for example, I have recently started learning Perl 6 and I will be taking on easy challenges to test my knowledge and learn new stuff. Feel free to ask any questions with regard to the choice of your language. And if you are an expert in the language then please take on a newbie and give a helping hand.  NOTE: The photo above is not us but it came with the theme, so we are using it. </description>

<title>Perl Weekly Challenge - 005</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-005/</link>
<description>The best part of the Perl Weekly Challenge is reading the blog by the members. Personally, I like the journey of an idea to final solution. If you look at closely all the blogs, every member has unique style. They all think differently but ends up with the same result. I have become fan of few in the last few weeks. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, reading code is fascinating but boring. If you read the story behind each approach is amazingly blockbuster.</description>

<description>Last week was really upsetting for me, I had call from my brother (India) telling me that Dad is unwell and currently admitted in ICU. I made quick arrangement and flew to India last Friday. I met my Dad the next day at the hospital. It was an emotional re-union of Father &#x26; Son. I am planning to stay with him for a week and flying back coming Sunday. In all of these, I tried to find time to get as much covered as possible. Apology if you find things not in place this week and following week.</description>

<title>[ Perl | Raku | The ] Weekly Challenge - 2020</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/plan-2020/</link>
<description>It has been wonderful journey so far in the year 2019. When I started the journey in March, I didn&#x2019;t know it would take this shape. All credit goes to the support of Perl/Raku community in general. It would be unfair if I pick few names. You know who I am talking about anyway. Let me share the story with you all.</description>

<description> As you know, Perl Weekly Challenge, primarily focus on Perl and Raku. During the Week #018, we received the solution to &#x201C;Perl Weekly Challenge - 018&#x201D; by Orestis Zekai in Python. It was a pleasant surprise to receive solution in something other than Perl and Raku. Ever since regular team members also started contributing in other languages like C++, Go, Haskell, Javascript, Postscript, Prolog, R, Rust and HTML. Please find below guest contributions. </description>

<description>Kian-Meng Ang had been reviewing Perl Solutions since week #007. I know you all appreciated the quality review done by Kian-Meng Ang. For some reason, Kian-Meng decided to take a break from the voluntary job. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Kian-Meng Ang for all the hard work. The change in team forced me take over the role. So from now on, you would see weekly review of Perl Solutions by me. I have changed the format slightly just to break the flow. I hope you are going to love it as much as you used to before. I would love to hear any suggestions to improve.</description>

<description>Last week, Yet Ebreo, joined the Perl Weekly Challenge like any other team members. However I noticed something special about him. He appeared to be very enthusiasts. In the very first week, He submitted solutions in Perl5 and Perl6. Well he didn&#x2019;t stop there, he even blogged about it. Did he stop there? Well not, he started solving all the past challenges. In the series, he started with Perl Weekly Challenge - 001, [P5 #1], [P5 #2], [P6 #1] and [P6 #2]. I am really impressed. I wish him good luck.</description>

<description>Last week, we had a guest contributor, Orestis Zekai, works as a Software Engineer. He doesn&#x2019;t know Perl but fluent in Python. He came across earlier weekly challenges and found it fun. So he decided to solve the Perl Weekly Challenge - 018 using Python language, Task #1 and Task #2. He wouldn&#x2019;t be part of weekly competition, though.</description>

<title>Perl Weekly Challenge - 003</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-003/</link>
<description>Last week challenge turned out to be a cakewalk for Perl 6 hackers. This shows my lack of knowledge of Perl 6. I have requested our inhouse Perl 6 experts to share some challenging questions. I already received few and kept in the challenge bank. I will use it in the coming weeks. Credit will be given to the hacker when published. We highly recommend that you submit you solutions as PR to the repository. If you need help with regard to submitting Pull Request, there is handy guide. A gentle reminder, please don&#x2019;t try to golf your solution. We are looking for unique way to solve the problem. Last week, newly joined member even submit test script, which is handy but not required. Also please mention any prereqs to execute the solution i.e. version of Perl or Raku. Please add meaningful comment to your code, in case anyone (most likely me) reading your code. Avoid using external library as much as possible. Try to get the solution straight out of the language. We encourage you to blog about your solution, focus on how you achieve the result. If you do blog then please share with us.</description>

<description>I was little late in releasing the weekly challenge last time. If I remember correctly it was around 4am Monday morning. Still, by 9am (UK time), I had first solution as PR by none other than the Scimon Procotor himself. And within the next hour, he submitted the solution to the second challenge. By lunch time, I had one more member Ozzy submitted solution to the first challenge.</description>

I didn&#x2019;t have to wait longer, Pete Houston sent us the solution in Perl5 by email. Finally we had our first complete solution in Perl5 by Dave Jacoby as Pull Request [#271]. Chart started looking balanced.</description>

<description>I came to know about one secret player of Perl Weekly Challenge just few days ago. Any guesses? He is the Damian Conway. He doesn&#x2019;t need any introduction. My first encounter with him was when I bought his book Perl Best Practices. I have been a big fan of him since then. Checkout his blog. I would also like to mention another newly joined member Yozen Hernandez. He blogged first time ever that too about his solution to the Perl Weekly Challenge. In his blog he wrote something very nice and sweet at the end.</description>

<title>RECAP - Perl Weekly Challenge - 046</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/recap-challenge-046/</link>
<description>As you must have noticed, we have a new player to review Perl and Raku solutions. No prize for any guess. He is none other than, Ryan Thompson, himself. I know it is NOT an easy task and that too doing both. Hats off to Ryan for accepting the challenge. Team members have already appreciated his quality reviews. Please do share your suggestions.</description>

<title>RECAP - Perl Weekly Challenge - 009</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/recap-challenge-009/</link>
<description>I would like to this opportunity to thank one of the respected member Kian-Meng Ang for the help in reviewing Perl 5 challenges every week. Checkout her last review if you haven&#x2019;t seen already. Ever since I started reviewing the challenges, I am looking for volunteer to do the same for Perl 6. I know it is weekly commitment and can be tiresome. If we can create team of reviewers for each languages then it would be even more fun. I feel guilty every week not talking about Perl 6 magical solutions.</description>

<description> Damian Conway wrote a blog in the last week of May 2019 and confessed that he has been quietly playing at home with &#x201C;Perl Weekly Challenge&#x201D;. With this started the regular blog by him picking weekly challenge and presenting his views. I didn&#x2019;t want to loose the track of all his great work, so I decided to put together all his blogs dealing with various challenges in one place. It would be a great read for anyone interested in the detailed analysis. </description>

It is now even listed as official Perl Client on their website.</description>

During the Week #018, we received the solution to &#x201C;Perl Weekly Challenge - 018&#x201D; by Orestis Zekai in Python.

<description>You can send a one line email to perlweeklychallenge@yahoo.com. However we would like you to tell us about yourself in couple of lines e.g. your preferred choice of language, how long you have been using the language, your city and country. If you could send us a recent photo to show on the team page then that would be great, but it isn&#x27;t required.</description>

Or if you have GitHub profile then you can even submit your solutions as PR to the repository. A gentle reminder, please don&#x2019;t try to golf your solution. We are looking for unique way to solve the problem. Also please mention any prereqs to execute the solution i.e. version of Perl or Raku. Please add meaningful comment to your code, in case anyone (most likely me) reading your code. Avoid using external library as much as possible. Try to get the solution straight out of the language.

<description> As you know, Perl Weekly Challenge, primarily focus on Perl and Raku. During the Week #018, we received the solution to &#x201C;Perl Weekly Challenge - 018&#x201D; by Orestis Zekai in Python. It was a pleasant surprise to receive solution in something other than Perl and Raku. Ever since regular team members also started contributing in other languages like C++, Go, Haskell, Javascript, Postscript, Prolog, R, Rust and HTML. Please find below guest contributions. </description>

<description>Apology to all team members, the Weekly Challenge is still not on the track. Things have improved but there is still a lot to do. I am pleasantly suprised by the offer of help by all the team members. Ryan Thompson offered to do Perl Reviews, which is a big help. I will now have one less thing to worry about every week. Thanks Ryan Thompson.</description>

<title>Project: Rename Perl6 to Raku</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/welcome-raku/</link>
<description>I had been planning to kick start the mini project of renaming Perl6 to Raku on the official website of &#x201C;Perl Weekly Challenge&#x201D;. And the side project to this, shouldn&#x2019;t it be called &#x201C;The Weekly Challenge - Perl &#x26; Raku&#x201D;? This is sticky area and needed more time to go through various aspects. Renaming project wasn&#x2019;t too difficult to deal with but I was looking for some FREE time to do it properly.</description>

<description>The biggest pleasnt surprise of last week, was by Arne Sommer. He has been religiously contributing quality Raku solutions with impeccable blog every week. For the first time last week, I noticed he contributed Perl solutions. In the past, I have seen Perl contributors started contributing Raku solutions but the reversal never happend before. This is the proudest moment for me. Thanks Arne Sommer for your continuous support and encouragement.</description>
