<title>BLOG: The Weekly Challenge #049</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/blog-challenge-049/</link>
<description>This is my second blog for The Weekly Challenge. I am only able to participate, thanks to Ryan Thompson for helping me with the Perl and Raku reviews. I am going for Perl solutions first then will try to translate it into Raku next. I believe in coding to learn the language. With so many Raku experts around, I am not shy throwing questions up. I am now going to share my experience doing &#x201C;The Weekly Challenge - 049&#x201D;.</description>

<title>Perl Weekly Challenge - Guest Contributions</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/guest-contribution/</link>
<description>As you know, &#x201C;Perl Weekly Challenge&#x201D;, primarily focus on Perl and Raku. During the Week #018, we received the solution to &#x201C;Perl Weekly Challenge - 018&#x201D; by Orestis Zekai in Python. It was a pleasant surprise to receive solution in something other than Perl and Raku. Ever since regular team members also started contributing in other languages like APL, Bash, C++, Go, Haskell, Idris, Javascript, Node, Postscript, Prolog, R, Ruby, Rust and HTML.</description>

<title>HELP: How to contribute?</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/how-to-contribute/</link>
<description>First find out the latest challenge folder, more likely the highest numbered folder is the latest challenge folder e.g. challenge-002. If you are an existing member, you would probably find a folder by your name. For example, if your name is &#x201C;Joe Blog&#x201D; then there would be a folder called &#x201C;joe-blog&#x201D;. Under your named folder, you would find a file README. Depending on your choice of language, you should create a folder here e.g. perl for Perl and raku for Raku. Please keep everything lowercase. Inside each of these folders you can save your solutions. If it is perl script for Task #1 then call it ch-1.pl. Similarly if it is perl script for Task #2 then call it ch-2.pl. For Raku solutions, call it ch-1.p6 and ch-2.p6 respectively. And if you are writing one-liner then call it ch-1.sh or ch-2.sh. If you are contributing for the first time, please create your named folder as described above. Also let us know what name you would like us to use?</description>

<title>My first date with Raku</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/my-first-date-with-raku/</link>
<description>Ever since I started the Perl Weekly challenge i.e. 25th March 2019, I have been planning to take part in the weekly challenge. Because of lack of time, I couldn&#x2019;t take part in the past. In the Week #046, I finally took the plunge and contributed Perl solutions to the Perl Weekly Challenge - 046.</description>

<title>Laurent Rosenfeld Weekly Review: Challenge - 052</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/p6-review-challenge-052/</link>
<description>Before going into the subject, I should apologize for having suspended my reviews of the Perl Weekly Challenge submissions for about two and a half months. I had warned Mohammad Anwar about that and told him the reasons, but Mohammad did not make these reasons public. The reason is that I did not have time during that period, because I had a lot of work running a local electoral campaign. I can now gradly and proudly announce that I was elected on March 15, 2020 in the city council of my home town, Conflans Sainte-Honorine (35,000 inhabitants), Paris area, France. I should hopefully have more time now to resume my reviews.</description>

<title>Perl Weekly Challenge - 004</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-004/</link>
<description>I noticed last week, less participation than the previous week. Why? Honestly speaking I have no clue. Could it be the questions were too tricky for the challenge? The week before, I received the feedback that the questions were too easy and simple. So I went for little trickier one this time. It seems that I have to balance it somehow.</description>

<description>Last week was really upsetting for me, I had call from my brother (India) telling me that Dad is unwell and currently admitted in ICU. I made quick arrangement and flew to India last Friday. I met my Dad the next day at the hospital. It was an emotional re-union of Father &#x26; Son. I am planning to stay with him for a week and flying back coming Sunday. In all of these, I tried to find time to get as much covered as possible. Apology if you find things not in place this week and following week.</description>

<description>It is already time for the second challenge of &#x201C;Perl Weekly Challenge&#x201D; event. We have had very positive response so far. We will soon share the review of first challenge. You can send us your solutions by replying the same email that drops the weekly challenge to your inbox. If you are active on twitter then you can DM @PerlWChallenge as well. Or if you have GitHub profile then you can even submit your solutions as PR to the repository. A gentle reminder, please don&#x2019;t try to golf your solution. We are looking for unique way to solve the problem. Also please mention any prereqs to execute the solution i.e. version of Perl or Raku. Please add meaningful comment to your code, in case anyone (most likely me) reading your code. Avoid using external library as much as possible. Try to get the solution straight out of the language. We encourage you to blog about your solution, focus on how you achieve the result. If you do blog then please share with us.</description>

<title>Perl Weekly Challenge - 003</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-003/</link>
<description>Last week challenge turned out to be a cakewalk for Perl 6 hackers. This shows my lack of knowledge of Perl 6. I have requested our inhouse Perl 6 experts to share some challenging questions. I already received few and kept in the challenge bank. I will use it in the coming weeks. Credit will be given to the hacker when published. We highly recommend that you submit you solutions as PR to the repository. If you need help with regard to submitting Pull Request, there is handy guide. A gentle reminder, please don&#x2019;t try to golf your solution. We are looking for unique way to solve the problem. Last week, newly joined member even submit test script, which is handy but not required. Also please mention any prereqs to execute the solution i.e. version of Perl or Raku. Please add meaningful comment to your code, in case anyone (most likely me) reading your code. Avoid using external library as much as possible. Try to get the solution straight out of the language. We encourage you to blog about your solution, focus on how you achieve the result. If you do blog then please share with us.</description>

<description>Two recent tragedies really upset me the most, first the killing of George Floyd and second the killing of pregnant elephant in India. All Life Matters, including Black. I try to keep my political views to select few and avoid sharing on social media. I hope I am not crossing the lines here.</description>

<description>I came to know about one secret player of Perl Weekly Challenge just few days ago. Any guesses? He is the Damian Conway. He doesn&#x2019;t need any introduction. My first encounter with him was when I bought his book Perl Best Practices. I have been a big fan of him since then. Checkout his blog. I would also like to mention another newly joined member Yozen Hernandez. He blogged first time ever that too about his solution to the Perl Weekly Challenge. In his blog he wrote something very nice and sweet at the end.</description>

<title>Perl Weekly Challenge - 005</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-005/</link>
<description>The best part of the Perl Weekly Challenge is reading the blog by the members. Personally, I like the journey of an idea to final solution. If you look at closely all the blogs, every member has unique style. They all think differently but ends up with the same result. I have become fan of few in the last few weeks. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, reading code is fascinating but boring. If you read the story behind each approach is amazingly blockbuster.</description>

<description>Last Friday was the first day of Ramadan in the United Kingdom. Because of the fasting during the day, I try to preserve my energy and use it when necessary. You will probably notice delay in acceptance of your contributions during this month. I may not be able to respond to your email as promptly as before. Please bear with me in this holy month.</description>

<description>Last week, we had the opportunity to speak to the Perl Weekly Champion of last month, Alicia Bielsa. I would like to share the relationship between Perl Weekly Challenge and Perl Weekly Newsletter. I have been associated with Perl Weekly Newsletter since May 2018 as Co-Editor. The name Perl Weekly Challenge was naturally inspired by the Perl Weekly Newsletter. The Chief Editor, Gabor Szabo has been a big supporter of Perl Weekly Challenge. He has given us permanent space in his widely read and the most popular newsletter. I would like to thank, Elizabeth Mattijsen, creator of Rakudo Weekly Newsletter, for giving us regular space in the weekly newsletter.</description>

<description>A friend of mine, Jeff Goff (@DrForr) sadly killed in a scuba-diving accident while on vacation few days ago. I have known him for many years, mostly got to attend his talk at London Perl Workshop. I still remember his talk &#x201C;The Art of Programming&#x201D;. It was a very different experience where audience got to play with piece of paper during the entire talk. I only got the opportunity to have one-2-one conversation with him at The Perl Conference in Riga last year. I even had the pleasure to go to dinner with him one day during the conference. He was a gem of a person. He even contributed to CPAN. He would always encourage me, no matter what. Every time I post something on Twitter/Facebook, he would be the first to like or comment. He would always help me with Raku questions on Twitter.</description>

<title>RECAP - Perl Weekly Challenge - 002</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/recap-challenge-002/</link>
<description>I noticed the timing of releasing the weekly challenge is not helping anyone in UK timezone as I released around mid-night. So if somebody who lives in other side where it is day they get to try the challenge first. I realised within few hours of making the challenge public, I starts getting feedback but none from UK member. It is only when it is Monday morning, I see reactions from them. I am not saying anything wrong in this. Just sharing my point of view. I remember during the launch week, Simon Proctor nailed it with lightning fast response. However in the second week, Joelle Maslak was really quick and beat Simon Proctor. I got confused when I announced Simon Proctor was the first person to submit the solution. Simon correctly pointed out to me that Joelle Maslak actually did it before him.</description>

<description>Apology to all team members, the Weekly Challenge is still not on the track. Things have improved but there is still a lot to do. I am pleasantly suprised by the offer of help by all the team members. Ryan Thompson offered to do Perl Reviews, which is a big help. I will now have one less thing to worry about every week. Thanks Ryan Thompson.</description>

<title>Perl Weekly Challenge - 061</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-061/</link>
<description>I never miss the opportunity of celebration, no matter how small the occassion is. My form of celebration is sharing the achievements with the community in general. If you remember, I wrote a blog when we completed 3 months of weekly challenge. Then again when we completed 6 months. So why no celebration at the end of first anniversary? Certainly it was the biggest moments for all of us associated with Perl Weekly Challenge or rather The Weekly Challenge. I have plenty of excuses for not doing anything about it. In fact, I did start collecting the bits that meant a lot to all of us but then life took big turn (did I mention COVID-19?). So please hang in there, I will bring it out soon. I don&#x2019;t want to set the deadline as it puts me under immense pressure. If anyone wants to share their story then please feel free to send me over perlweeklychallenge@yahoo.com. It would be great to have as many success stories as possible.</description>

<description>Last week had been the toughest week for me. My dad is now back home and doing well. Thanks each and every person for the best wishes. I know everything is messed up at the moment. I came back from India with throat infection and really bad cough. I am not fully recovered yet but still improving day-by-day. I would like to thank Ryan Thompson for doing Perl Review in my absence. There is going to be a short pause on Raku review, please bear with us, unless someone from the team volunteer to take this challenge for a short period.</description>

<description>Last week, Yet Ebreo, joined the Perl Weekly Challenge like any other team members. However I noticed something special about him. He appeared to be very enthusiasts. In the very first week, He submitted solutions in Perl5 and Perl6. Well he didn&#x2019;t stop there, he even blogged about it. Did he stop there? Well not, he started solving all the past challenges. In the series, he started with Perl Weekly Challenge - 001, [P5 #1], [P5 #2], [P6 #1] and [P6 #2]. I am really impressed. I wish him good luck.</description>

<description>I would like to this opportunity to thank one of the respected member Kian-Meng Ang for the help in reviewing Perl 5 challenges every week. Checkout her last review if you haven&#x2019;t seen already. Ever since I started reviewing the challenges, I am looking for volunteer to do the same for Perl 6. I know it is weekly commitment and can be tiresome. If we can create team of reviewers for each languages then it would be even more fun. I feel guilty every week not talking about Perl 6 magical solutions.</description>

<description>Last week, we had a guest contributor, Orestis Zekai, works as a Software Engineer. He doesn&#x2019;t know Perl but fluent in Python. He came across earlier weekly challenges and found it fun. So he decided to solve the Perl Weekly Challenge - 018 using Python language, Task #1 and Task #2. He wouldn&#x2019;t be part of weekly competition, though.</description>

<description>Today, Monday 25th Nov, 2019, we have completed 8 months of successfull run of The Weekly Challenge. Over the period, I came across many smart hackers. I have lots of personal favourites that I always look forward to their solutions. It always brings a big smile on my face every time I look at their solutions. Sometimes, I find it difficult to grasp in first reading. But then once it settles down, the feeling is out of this world.</description>

Chart started looking balanced.</description>

<description>The biggest pleasnt surprise of last week, was by Arne Sommer. He has been religiously contributing quality Raku solutions with impeccable blog every week. For the first time last week, I noticed he contributed Perl solutions. In the past, I have seen Perl contributors started contributing Raku solutions but the reversal never happend before. This is the proudest moment for me. Thanks Arne Sommer for your continuous support and encouragement.</description>

<title>RECAP - Perl Weekly Challenge - 060</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/recap-challenge-060/</link>
<description>Couple of months ago, on the request of one of the Team PWC member, Wanderdoc, we created Early Bird Club. So what is it all about? The club members get the first glimpse of upcoming challenges. How can anyone join the club? Just drop us a line with your intention to perlweeklychallenge@yahoo.com. I always try to give the club members full weekend i.e. Saturday and Sunday to play with the upcoming challenges before others get their hand the following Monday morning. Currently we don&#x2019;t have many members in the club but if you are interested then please do let us know. Just to make it clear there are no strings attached to the membership. What does that mean? It means the deadline to submit the solutions is still the same like any other Team PWC members.</description>

<description>As you must have noticed, we have a new player to review Perl and Raku solutions. No prize for any guess. He is none other than, Ryan Thompson, himself. I know it is NOT an easy task and that too doing both. Hats off to Ryan for accepting the challenge. Team members have already appreciated his quality reviews. Please do share your suggestions.</description>

<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/recap-challenge-061/</link>
<description>We all know, Perl Weekly Challenge, primarily focus on Perl and Raku. However, in recent weeks, I noticed Team PWC members actively sharing solutions in other guest languages. As of today, we have received solutions in 16 guest languages, Python being the most popular language. There is still scope for more guest languages. If you haven&#x2019;t tried anything so far then why not give it a try.</description>

<description>Today, I am going to talk about one of the prominent member of Team PWC, Arne Sommer. I am confident you must have come across his contributions. He has been taking in the weekly challenge for sometime now. He mostly does Raku solution. He also does blog every week. I would like to share a very special quality of him, i.e. creative blog title. Please checkout below what I mean.</description>

<description>Kian-Meng Ang had been reviewing Perl Solutions since week #007. I know you all appreciated the quality review done by Kian-Meng Ang. For some reason, Kian-Meng decided to take a break from the voluntary job. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Kian-Meng Ang for all the hard work. The change in team forced me take over the role. So from now on, you would see weekly review of Perl Solutions by me. I have changed the format slightly just to break the flow. I hope you are going to love it as much as you used to before. I would love to hear any suggestions to improve.</description>

<description>This is my second blog for The Weekly Challenge. I am only able to participate, thanks to Ryan Thompson for helping me with the Perl and Raku reviews. I am going for Perl solutions first then will try to translate it into Raku next. I believe in coding to learn the language. With so many Raku experts around, I am not shy throwing questions up. I am now going to share my experience doing &#x201C;The Weekly Challenge - 049&#x201D;.</description>

<description>I had great fun working with Merge Intervals task this week. I didn&#x2019;t know it was going to be more harder to solve than Noble number task. Keeping in mind the sample data provided with the task, I came up with solution very quickly. I was very happy with the result.</description>

<title>BLOG: The Weekly Challenge #051</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/weekly-challenge-051/</link>
<description>I am really enjoying the weekly challenges, specially doing in Raku. The point of blogging is also about sharing my fight with Raku. I hardly write anything about my Perl solution as I don&#x2019;t see anything new to talk about. Having said that, I still go for Perl first as it is my first love and will remain so rest of my life. Even today, my brain is so tuned to Perl, every ideas come in form and shape of Perl only. I started contributing in the Week #46. I could only find time to do Perl solutions in the Week #46. The following Week #47 was the same as I didn&#x2019;t get to do Raku. It was the Week #48 when I managed to find time to do both Perl and Raku for the first time. Ever since I have been able to contribute every week in both languages. I would give the credit to the fellow Team PWC member, Ryan Thompson, for helping me with the Perl and Raku reviews.</description>

<title>BLOG: The Weekly Challenge #055</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/weekly-challenge-055/</link>
<description>The Perl Weekly Challenge - 055 was the most difficult week for me ever since I started contributing. Usually I submit my Perl and Raku by Wednesday but this time, I was working overtime and could only finished by Sunday afternoon. I must confess that I didn&#x2019;t realise it was going to be as this difficult when I came up with the challenge. I am happy that I did it at the end of the day. This time, I submitted unit test version of both tasks in Perl and Raku. I always start with standalone app keeping in mind that this would be re-used in unit test script. I try to get the meaty subroutines drafted first then it just becomes a very thin wrapper around to get both standalone app and unit test script. My initial plan was to use bit operator to solve the Flip Binary task. Having spent couple of hours fighting, I gave up in the end. Eventually I hacked shamelessly as string to get the job done. I followed the standard pattern and solved the task in Perl first then jumped on Raku.</description>

<description>For the first time, since I started participating the weekly challenges, I thought of doing one-liner. With handy CPAN modules, it was pretty straight forward in Perl. Even Raku with built-in features wasn&#x2019;t far behind Perl. Like in the past, I learn something new in Raku every week. This week was no different. I will share what I learnt this time later.</description>

<description>I noticed now a days, I go for solution with unit test. I will give the credit to fellow Team PWC member, E. Choroba. It feels great when you see the test pass at the end. Well the solution looks little different than just standalone solution. For that reason, I decided to do both for Raku solutions. Also this allowed me to explore unit testing in Raku.</description>

<description>Before I say anything about my contributions, I would like to share my sweet encounter with Raku. Last week while working on the task Flip Binary using Raku, I was struggling to figure out all the binary strings with maximum 1s. I had the results in a Hash where key was the binary string and value was the total count of 1s in it. The idea was to sort the Hash by values first then sort by keys. After posting the question on the Twitter handle @PerlWChallenge, I received the below solution by PawgChamp (@Mrofnet).</description>

<description>Of the two tasks, my favourite was Shortest Unique Prefix. I must confess I have never done this before. It was fun solving though. I enjoyed it thoroughly. As always, Raku solution looks more elegant, in my hunble opinion. With every passing week, I learn something new in Raku and get to practice what I learnt so far. The weekly challenge is giving me an opportunity to explore the nitty gritty of Raku.</description>

<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/weekly-challenge-058/</link>
<description>This week, I struggled with both the task, to be honest. Dealing with alpha part of the version was really pain in the neck. Every time, I struggle with any task, I follow the college days course of action i.e. pick a pend and paper. I start dribbling the thought process, it really helps in getting the idea out on the paper. Once the rough draft is ready, it is time to face the unit test trial. I make sure every solution of mine must go through the unit test trials. It flesh out edge cases most time, if I could come up with enough test cases.</description>

<title>BLOG: The Weekly Challenge #059</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/weekly-challenge-059/</link>
<description>This week, I changed the format of my weekly blog slightly. Why? Well, I wanted to keep the Perl and Raku solutions next to each other so that it is easier for reader (me, mostly) to see the difference. It gives me immense pleasure to see the end result when I am done translating Perl solutions into Raku. It looks lot cleaner and precise. The only thing it is behind is performance when I do comparison. For that I would blame myself partly as I am still learning the magic of Raku. For now, my objective is to wire my brain according to the rules of Raku. Once it is wired properly and stable then I would start playing the trick with it. That is the plan, how far I am going to succeed is another matter. I am not in rush to be honest. The central GitHub Repository is the collection of many gems by so many Raku experts. I know for sure, if I struggle in future then I can easily look for better solutions in the bank.</description>

<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/weekly-challenge-061/</link>
<description>At first, I thought Product SubArray is easy task. Therefore I went public categorised as Task #1. My definition of easy task is you just start coding without doing any ground work. However when I started coding, I had to take a pause and do processing in my head befoore coding. So then as per my definition, Product SubArray no longer consider as an easy task. After finishing the task in no time once I understood the flow, it turned out to be clean solution. I must confess, my brain still do thinking as per the rules of Perl. I am hoping, one day I could do the mental processing in Raku. The IPv4 Partition task was the tough nut to crack honestly speaking at first. After working out the logic on paper, it becomes easier. Overall, fun and twisting tasks to work on.</description>

<description>Once again, Neil Bowers, came up with another exciting task for all Team PWC members. Like always, it was fun task. Thanks to Ryan for providng sample data and expected result based on the definition of the task. Half the job done already. The only thing left for the us, is get on with the job. I noticed Raku needed slightly different approach then the Perl. It could be I am doing something very badly. I am happy to correct myself, if you find anything silly. More on this, later down below.</description>

<description>I am not sure about you guys but I found writing blog is very nice feeling. I get nice ideas to clean up the code. This week, I even found a bug that even unit test couldn&#x2019;t catch. I would rather not share it, quite embarassing. The bug was in my Perl solutions to the &#x201C;Find Numbers&#x201D; task. My git commit tree might disclose it, if you really want to know.</description>

<title>The Weekly Challenge - Perl &#x26; Raku</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/</link>
<description>Let me share my journey of getting into computing. It all started in the year 1993, I just joined the 3 year degree course of B.Sc (Math Honours). It was during the first year, I realised doing just degree is not going to help me secure a job that I needed desparately to support my family. A friend of mine asked me if I am interested to join computer training course. Without giving any thought, I decided to join him and went to a local branch of APTECH, a well known name in computer training institute in India. When we reached their office and enquired about various courses they were offerings. We were told to give an aptitute test before we can join any course. I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the test but decided to give it a try. We both secured over 90% mark in the test. My friend was fully prepared, so he started dicussing about the courses. At the end he decided to join one year course in &#x22;Diploma In Information and System Management&#x22; (DISM). At the time, the fee was INR 13,000. But I didn&#x27;t have the money to join the course. I told my mother about it. Like any mother, she decided to sell her wedding jewellery to pay my fees. It was important for me to start earning asap. I was hoping this course would help me land a decent job. I joined the course 6 months later. On the very first day of course, I noticed the same friend is my course faculty. He was a bright student, therefore APTECH offered him the job while he was still doing his course there. We were taught Foxpro and COBOL programming language as a part of the course. At the end of the course, I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the knowledge I had. So I decided to learn few other programming languages. The trouble was, I didn&#x27;t have PC/Laptop to practice and also not enough money to buy computer books. I joined a local library called &#x22;Muslim Library&#x22; as it was FREE and started borrowing books from there. The library was very far from where I lived. I had to take 2 bus journeys to get there. Sometimes, I didn&#x27;t even have enough money to pay the bus fare. My older sister, who used to give home tution, always helped me. I learnt Pascal by just reading books. Then I learnt &#x22;C&#x22; but this time, I found out one of my friend is running computer training institute. So I went to him and asked if I can use his PC when ever it is available. In return I would teach his students. He kindly accepted my offer. While I was still exploring &#x22;C&#x22; language, I saw an advert about a multinational computer training center opening in Jamshedpur called INFOTECH. I decided to apply for the post of Faculty. But I only got the job of &#x22;Lab Assistant&#x22; for INR 2000 per month. For me that was a lot of money as I could support my family, specially my younger brother who was still in college. There was an added advantage being a Lab Assistant, I could have as much PC time as I like. I learnt Oracle during my time there and got promoted to Faculty after one year.</description>

<title>Project: Rename Perl6 to Raku</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/welcome-raku/</link>
<description>I had been planning to kick start the mini project of renaming Perl6 to Raku on the official website of &#x201C;Perl Weekly Challenge&#x201D;. And the side project to this, shouldn&#x2019;t it be called &#x201C;The Weekly Challenge - Perl &#x26; Raku&#x201D;? This is sticky area and needed more time to go through various aspects. Renaming project wasn&#x2019;t too difficult to deal with but I was looking for some FREE time to do it properly.</description>

<title>About Us</title>
<link>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/about/</link>
<description> We are a bunch of Perl 5 and Perl 6 hackers. The main purpose behind this project is to learn something new from each other. The most important thing is to have fun. We will try to keep it simple and easy for anyone to join us. The main point is that you don&#x27;t need to be an expert in the language. Even if you are new to the language, you will find some easy challenges to start with. Take me for example, I have recently started learning Perl 6 and I will be taking on easy challenges to test my knowledge and learn new stuff. Feel free to ask any questions with regard to the choice of your language. And if you are an expert in the language then please take on a newbie and give a helping hand.  NOTE: The photo above is not us but it came with the theme, so we are using it. </description>

<description>After the most difficult week (Week #062), it was very satisfying. I found both the tasks this week (Week #063) fun and challenging. The best part was that I could do both tasks in an hour, which is rare. I liked the &#x201C;Rotate String&#x201D; task very much. Thanks to Ryan, we already had test cases handy for the &#x201C;Last Word&#x201D; task. I will talk about each in detail down below.</description>

<description>You can send a one line email to perlweeklychallenge@yahoo.com. However we would like you to tell us about yourself in couple of lines e.g. your preferred choice of language, how long you have been using the language, your city and country. If you could send us a recent photo to show on the team page then that would be great, but it isn&#x27;t required.</description>

During the Week #018, we received the solution to &#x201C;Perl Weekly Challenge - 018&#x201D; by Orestis Zekai in Python. It was a pleasant surprise to receive solution in something other than Perl and Raku. Ever since regular team members also started contributing in other languages like APL, Bash, C++, Go, Haskell, Idris, Javascript, Node, Postscript, Prolog, R, Ruby, Rust and HTML. </description>

<title>Raku</title>

<description> HEADLINES Few days ago, Colin Crain, offered to do Perl review of the past challenges. A big THANK YOU from all of us. Soon we will have the fun of reading reviews. I am still looking for Raku, just a gentle reminder. It would be nice, if both kickstart together. I have been hooked into YouTube video of live coding by Richard Park. It was Richard who first started sharing his YouTube video of live coding. </description>

<description> Damian Conway wrote a blog in the last week of May 2019 and confessed that he has been quietly playing at home with &#x201C;Perl Weekly Challenge&#x201D;. With this started the regular blog by him picking weekly challenge and presenting his views. I didn&#x2019;t want to loose the track of all his great work, so I decided to put together all his blogs dealing with various challenges in one place. It would be a great read for anyone interested in the detailed analysis. </description>
