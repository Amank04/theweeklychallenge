      <description>Advent Calendar 2019
The gift is presented by Gustavo Chaves. Today he is talking about his solutions to Task #1: Base35 Representation of &amp;ldquo;The Weekly Challenge - 002&amp;rdquo;.
Write a script that can convert numbers to and from a base35 representation, using the characters 0-9 and A-Y. I cannot do it as a one-liner this time, but it was still fun. While trying to solve it I realized that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be much harder to implement a general solution to convert from any base to any base between 2 and 36.</description>

The gift is presented by Roger Bell_West. Today he is talking about his solutions to Task #2: Word Game of &amp;ldquo;The Weekly Challenge - 038&amp;rdquo;.
Lets assume we have tiles as listed below, with an alphabet (A..Z) printed on them. Each tile has a value, e.g. A (1 point), B (4 points) etc. You are allowed to draw 7 tiles from the lot randomly. Then try to form a word using the 7 tiles with maximum points altogether.</description>

The gift is presented by Philippe Bruhat. Today he is talking about his solutions to Task #2: FizzBuzz of &amp;ldquo;The Weekly Challenge - 001&amp;rdquo;.
Write one-liner to solve FizzBuzz problem and print number 1-20. However, any number divisible by 3 should be replaced by the word fizz and any divisible by 5 by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by both become fizz buzz. This one works by modifying the string until what’s we’re left with is the expected result:</description>

Write a script to implement Vigenère cipher. The script should be able encode and decode. Checkout wiki page for more information. This seemed like a cool challenge to tackle. Knowing next to nothing about encryption, I was worried that this would take me all week.</description>

Demonstrate Array Slices or Hash slices. 
To demonstate some different Array and Hash slicing features I do some image processing. An image is &amp;ldquo;data&amp;rdquo; that can be stored in 2- or 3-dimensional Arrays. To separate the data I will store the data in Hashes (Named Lists).</description>

      <description>HELP: How to contribute? Just submit Pull Request to GitHub repository with your solutions. First find out the latest challenge folder, more likely the highest numbered folder is the latest challenge folder e.g. challenge-002. If you are an existing member, you would probably find a folder by your name. For example, if your name is &amp;ldquo;Joe Blog&amp;rdquo; then there would be a folder called &amp;ldquo;joe-blog&amp;rdquo;. Under your named folder, you would find a file README.</description>

The gift is presented by Dave Cross. Today he is talking about his solutions to Task #1: Find 5 Weekends of &amp;ldquo;The Weekly Challenge - 019&amp;rdquo;.
Write a script to display months from the year 1900 to 2019 where you find 5 weekends i.e. 5 Friday, 5 Saturday and 5 Sunday. This would be simple enough to just brute-force. But when I started to think about it, I realised there’s a bit of a trick we can use which can cut down our search space quite significantly.</description>

      <description>HEADLINES Today, Monday 25th Nov, 2019, we have completed 8 months of successfull run of The Weekly Challenge. Over the period, I came across many smart hackers. I have lots of personal favourites that I always look forward to their solutions. It always brings a big smile on my face every time I look at their solutions. Sometimes, I find it difficult to grasp in first reading. But then once it settles down, the feeling is out of this world.</description>

In the very first week, He submitted solutions in Perl5 and Perl6. Well he didn&amp;rsquo;t stop there, he even blogged about it. Did he stop there? Well not, he started solving all the past challenges. In the series, he started with Perl Weekly Challenge - 001, [P5 #1], [P5 #2], [P6 #1] and [P6 #2].</description>

For a quick overview, go through the original tasks and recap of the weekly challenge.
We&amp;rsquo;re going to review thing a bit differently for this week by listing down all the CPAN modules used for a particular task. The modules usage reflects three things, the coding style of a participant (Function::Parameters) the common used module (Math::Prime::Util) to solve a particular problem, and the trend of module usage (Modern::Perl) which was seen quite often in the last few challenges.</description>

      <description>I have been thinking to do review of optional API task so far. I have now finally got the time.
BACKGROUND During the Perl Weekly challenge 005, Gabor Szabo, Chief Editor of Perl Weekly newsletter proposed optional API task to the weekly challenge. He even suggested list of API that I could use every week. It took me couple of weeks to figure out the format and other formalities. Finally it was introduced with the Perl Weekly Challenge - 008.</description>

      <description>We are now 3 months old and growing fast every week with the support of wider Perl Community.
The prime motto of the &amp;ldquo;Perl Weekly Challenge&amp;rdquo; is to promote Perl (be it Perl5 or Perl6). I was looking for fun way of doing it. Being, co-editor of Perl Weekly newsletter, I noticed that not many people blog about interesting use of the language. I must say, Perl6 community is doing far better than Perl5.</description>

Kevin Colyer submitted the next in Perl6 as Github gist. By now, I started thinking where are all #Perl5 hackers. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to wait longer, Pete Houston sent us the solution in Perl5 by email. Finally we had our first complete solution in Perl5 by Dave Jacoby as Pull Request [#271].</description>

This week was quite unique as we observed there were several submissions where submissions were based on existing solutions but were done in a more alternative and elegant way. Moreover, some of these show case the expressiveness of Perl programming language itself, which is also one of the key goal of this weekly challenge.</description>

By lunch time, I had one more member Ozzy submitted solution to the first challenge.

For those who are new to the weekly review post, the main purpose of weekly review is to document down interesting approaches of using Perl programming language to solve each week challenges. Code reading or review allows us to learn / relearn, discover / rediscover, and appreciate / reappreciate (some participants uses other programming languages in their day job) new, interesting, and quirky things accomplished with Perl (unfortunately Perl 5 for now).</description>

Challenge #1 The Wikipage page have a good introduction and manual calculation of conversion of Arabic numerals to Roman numerals. Read Laurent Rosenfeld&amp;rsquo;s blog post for the finer implementation details.
Most participants uses a hash to map between Arabic and Roman numerals. Since order of the matching roman numerals against the Arabic values is important, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to sort it before any conversion.</description>

      <description>Continues from previous post. Follow up on this week review of Perl Weekly Challenge #009 answers submitted by all the participants. Read the full question list and the recap of the challenge to have an overview before we proceed with our review.
Challenge #1 Since most first question is beginner friendly, there are two steps to solve the problem. First, we need to loop through a series of numbers. Next, determine whether a square number has at least five distinct digits.</description>

      <description>I came to know about one secret player of Perl Weekly Challenge just few days ago. Any guesses? He is the Damian Conway. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t need any introduction. My first encounter with him was when I bought his book Perl Best Practices. I have been a big fan of him since then. Checkout his blog. I would also like to mention another newly joined member Yozen Hernandez. He blogged first time ever that too about his solution to the Perl Weekly Challenge.</description>

      <description>I would like to this opportunity to thank one of the respected member Kian-Meng Ang for the help in reviewing Perl 5 challenges every week. Checkout her last review if you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen already. Ever since I started reviewing the challenges, I am looking for volunteer to do the same for Perl 6. I know it is weekly commitment and can be tiresome. If we can create team of reviewers for each languages then it would be even more fun.</description>

      <description>The Challenge - 008 participation was same as the Challenge - 007 in terms of number of members participated. However this time we received more than solution with the introduction of the optional third API challenge. As a matter of fact, Joelle Maslak care to answer the third challenge. She solved the third challenge in Perl5 and Perl6.
Adam Russell Adam making good use of unpack() to solve the perfect numbers challenge.</description>

      <description>Below is the write-up review (only covers Perl 5) of the Perl Weekly Challenge #007 of all the submitted answers. You can read the original questions first to understand the details of these two challenges.
Challenge #1 If we read the question carefully, there are several steps to solve this problem. First, to find all niven number from 0 to 50 inclusively. Second, to find the sum of its digits of this range of number.</description>

      <description>Last week was better than the previous week. I noticed big rush on Saturday and Sunday always. As we are getting into 8th week, members are getting the hang of it, which is nice.
Adam Russell Adam once again came up with unique solution using pack and unpack to solve the challenge #1. I really liked the graph solution for challenge #2. [#1] [#2] [BLOG]
Alicia Bielsa Alicia submitted the solution to the challenge #1.</description>

      <description>Last week was not very active in terms of number of participations. Having said that the quality of the solutions is always on the top. Some went for the kill, you can&amp;rsquo;t afford to miss it. Enjoy the code.
Adam Russell Adam got the help from CPAN module Data::Dump and the end result is unbelievable simple. Check out his code.
Alicia Bielsa Alicia submitted the solution to the first question.</description>

      <description>Perl Weekly Challenge introduced me to so many genious around the globe. It would be unfair to name a few. You know who I am talking about. The main objective of the project was to introduce Perl to more people and allow sharing the magic of Perl. In the last 5 weeks, I can say that I have personally learnt a lot from many greats.

      <description>I would like to talk about blog written by some members this week. In the past, I went into the details of Perl 5 solutions mainly. Lets change the trend this time.
Following blogs have been reported last week. Each blog is a text book in itself as it teaches you so many things. I enjoyed reading each and every blog. Please do read them when you get time.</description>

      <description>The best part of the Perl Weekly Challenge is reading the blog by the members. Personally, I like the journey of an idea to final solution. If you look at closely all the blogs, every member has unique style. They all think differently but ends up with the same result. I have become fan of few in the last few weeks. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, reading code is fascinating but boring.</description>

      <description>For the first time ever, I published RECAP blog before the weekly challenge. It is the sign that things are settling down. Members are using Pull Request more frequently to submit the solutions. Last Sunday, when I made the Challenge 004 public, I couple of people responded in no time.
The first person was Kivanc Yazan and he announced it on Twitter.
The next person followed him was @smokemachine. He has been regular since last week.</description>

      <description>I noticed last week, less participation than the previous week. Why? Honestly speaking I have no clue. Could it be the questions were too tricky for the challenge? The week before, I received the feedback that the questions were too easy and simple. So I went for little trickier one this time. It seems that I have to balance it somehow.
I am gratefull to all members submitting the solutions as Pull Request.</description>

      <description>Every week, I release the challenge by email first and then on Twitter. I wait for about 30 minutes to get the first response to the challenge. I also look at the Google Analytics Realtime Chart to see how many users are reading the new challenge page and from which part of the world.
Last week, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to wait long, I saw the first reaction on Twitter from Khalid.</description>

      <description>As received in response to the challenge by Philippe Bruhat. Highly recommended.
 Write a script or one-liner to remove leading zeros from positive numbers.
 As a filter:
perl -ple &#39;s/^0+//&#39;  Challenge #2  Write a script that can convert numbers to and from a base35 representation, using the characters 0-9 and A-Y.
 Those who remember The Perl Review Code golf contest may remember this challenge.</description>

      <description>I noticed the timing of releasing the weekly challenge is not helping anyone in UK timezone as I released around mid-night. So if somebody who lives in other side where it is day they get to try the challenge first. I realised within few hours of making the challenge public, I starts getting feedback but none from UK member. It is only when it is Monday morning, I see reactions from them.</description>

      <description>Last week challenge turned out to be a cakewalk for Perl 6 hackers. This shows my lack of knowledge of Perl 6. I have requested our inhouse Perl 6 experts to share some challenging questions. I already received few and kept in the challenge bank. I will use it in the coming weeks. Credit will be given to the hacker when published. We highly recommend that you submit you solutions as PR to the repository.</description>

Apology for the delay, I was supposed to release this blog with the second challenge of the series. I promise next blog is going to be on time.
For the first time ever, the Monday 25th March 2019, was not depressing like any other Monday. Thanks to &amp;ldquo;Perl Weekly Challenge&amp;rdquo;, I was so busy following public reactions on Twitter. It was a memorable experience.</description>
