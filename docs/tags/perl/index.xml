By lunch time, I had one more member Ozzy submitted solution to the first challenge.

Checkout her last review if you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen already. Ever since I started reviewing the challenges, I am looking for volunteer to do the same for Perl 6. I know it is weekly commitment and can be tiresome. If we can create team of reviewers for each languages then it would be even more fun.</description>

      <description>Last week was not very active in terms of number of participations. Having said that the quality of the solutions is always on the top. Some went for the kill, you can&amp;rsquo;t afford to miss it. Enjoy the code.
Adam Russell Adam got the help from CPAN module Data::Dump and the end result is unbelievable simple. Check out his code.
Alicia Bielsa Alicia submitted the solution to the first question.</description>

      <description>I would like to talk about blog written by some members this week. In the past, I went into the details of Perl 5 solutions mainly. Lets change the trend this time.
Following blogs have been reported last week. Each blog is a text book in itself as it teaches you so many things. I enjoyed reading each and every blog. Please do read them when you get time.</description>

      <description>For the first time ever, I published RECAP blog before the weekly challenge. It is the sign that things are settling down. Members are using Pull Request more frequently to submit the solutions. Last Sunday, when I made the Challenge 004 public, I couple of people responded in no time.
The first person was Kivanc Yazan and he announced it on Twitter.
The next person followed him was @smokemachine. He has been regular since last week.</description>

      <description>Every week, I release the challenge by email first and then on Twitter. I wait for about 30 minutes to get the first response to the challenge. I also look at the Google Analytics Realtime Chart to see how many users are reading the new challenge page and from which part of the world.
Last week, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to wait long, I saw the first reaction on Twitter from Khalid.</description>

      <description>I noticed the timing of releasing the weekly challenge is not helping anyone in UK timezone as I released around mid-night. So if somebody who lives in other side where it is day they get to try the challenge first. I realised within few hours of making the challenge public, I starts getting feedback but none from UK member. It is only when it is Monday morning, I see reactions from them.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the first weekly recap of &amp;ldquo;Perl Weekly Challenge&amp;rdquo;.
Apology for the delay, I was supposed to release this blog with the second challenge of the series. I promise next blog is going to be on time.
For the first time ever, the Monday 25th March 2019, was not depressing like any other Monday. Thanks to &amp;ldquo;Perl Weekly Challenge&amp;rdquo;, I was so busy following public reactions on Twitter. It was a memorable experience.</description>
