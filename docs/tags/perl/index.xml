Today we are talking to PokGoPun, the winner of June 2022 of The Weekly Challenge. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.
 Mohammad: Tell us about your technical background?
PokGoPun: My passion in computer programming started since childhood when my parents brought home 8-bit home computer that equipped with Microsoft Extended BASIC, I recalled hooking the computer to TV, writing and running BASIC programs and then saving them to cassette tape for later modification, what a fun!</description>
