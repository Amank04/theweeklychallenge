      <description>HELP: How to contribute? Just submit Pull Request to GitHub repository with your solutions. First find out the latest challenge folder, more likely the highest numbered folder is the latest challenge folder e.g. challenge-002. If you are an existing member, you would probably find a folder by your name. For example, if your name is &amp;ldquo;Joe Blog&amp;rdquo; then there would be a folder called &amp;ldquo;joe-blog&amp;rdquo;. Under your named folder, you would find a file README.</description>

      <description>Damian Conway wrote a blog in the last week of May 2019 and confessed that he has been quietly playing at home with &amp;ldquo;Perl Weekly Challenge&amp;rdquo;. With this started the regular blog by him picking weekly challenge and presenting his views.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to loose the track of all his great work, so I decided to put together all his blogs dealing with various challenges in one place. It would be a great read for anyone interested in the detailed analysis.</description>

BACKGROUND During the Perl Weekly challenge 005, Gabor Szabo, Chief Editor of Perl Weekly newsletter proposed optional API task to the weekly challenge.

Finally it was introduced with the Perl Weekly Challenge - 008.</description>

      <description>We are now 3 months old and growing fast every week with the support of wider Perl Community.
The prime motto of the &amp;ldquo;Perl Weekly Challenge&amp;rdquo; is to promote Perl (be it Perl5 or Perl6). I was looking for fun way of doing it. Being, co-editor of Perl Weekly newsletter, I noticed that not many people blog about interesting use of the language. I must say, Perl6 community is doing far better than Perl5.</description>

My first encounter with him was when I bought his book Perl Best Practices. I have been a big fan of him since then. Checkout his blog. I would also like to mention another newly joined member Yozen Hernandez. He blogged first time ever that too about his solution to the Perl Weekly Challenge.</description>

      <description>Perl Weekly Challenge introduced me to so many genious around the globe. It would be unfair to name a few. You know who I am talking about. The main objective of the project was to introduce Perl to more people and allow sharing the magic of Perl. In the last 5 weeks, I can say that I have personally learnt a lot from many greats.

      <description>The best part of the Perl Weekly Challenge is reading the blog by the members. Personally, I like the journey of an idea to final solution. If you look at closely all the blogs, every member has unique style. They all think differently but ends up with the same result. I have become fan of few in the last few weeks. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, reading code is fascinating but boring.</description>

      <description>I noticed last week, less participation than the previous week. Why? Honestly speaking I have no clue. Could it be the questions were too tricky for the challenge? The week before, I received the feedback that the questions were too easy and simple. So I went for little trickier one this time. It seems that I have to balance it somehow.
I am gratefull to all members submitting the solutions as Pull Request.</description>

      <description>Last week challenge turned out to be a cakewalk for Perl 6 hackers. This shows my lack of knowledge of Perl 6. I have requested our inhouse Perl 6 experts to share some challenging questions. I already received few and kept in the challenge bank. I will use it in the coming weeks. Credit will be given to the hacker when published. We highly recommend that you submit you solutions as PR to the repository.</description>
