      <description>As you know, The Weekly Challenge, primarily focus on Perl and Raku. During the Week #018, we received solutions to &amp;ldquo;The Weekly Challenge - 018&amp;rdquo; by Orestis Zekai in Python. It was pleasant surprise to receive solutions in something other than Perl and Raku. Ever since regular team members also started contributing in other languages like APL, Awk, Bash, Bc, C, C++, Clojure, Elm, Erlang, Gembase, Go, Haskell, HTML, Idris, Java, Javascript, Kotlin, Lisp, Lua, Node, OCaml, Postscript, Prolog, R, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Swift, Tcl and XSLT.</description>

      <description>It has been wonderful journey so far in the year 2019. When I started the journey in March, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it would take this shape. All credit goes to the support of Perl/Raku community in general. It would be unfair if I pick few names. You know who I am talking about anyway. Let me share the story with you all.
I was working on 2 ideas at the start of the year 2019, &amp;ldquo;Perl Weekly Challenge&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;London Hack Day&amp;rdquo;.</description>
