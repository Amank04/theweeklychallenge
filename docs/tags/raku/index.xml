      <description>Raku and I: Journey begin &amp;hellip;  It has been ages since I last blogged about Raku. The only time, I have blogged about when I took part in The Weekly Challenge. But then this also changed recently as I finally found time to contribute to the weekly fun challenges but no blogging still.
I would say it is all about my mental state, since I have so much to talk about.</description>
