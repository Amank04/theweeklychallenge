      <description>As you know, &amp;ldquo;Perl Weekly Challenge&amp;rdquo;, primarily focus on Perl and Raku. During the Week #018, we received the solution to &amp;ldquo;Perl Weekly Challenge - 018&amp;rdquo; by Orestis Zekai in Python. It was a pleasant surprise to receive solution in something other than Perl and Raku. Ever since regular team members also started contributing in other languages like C++, Go, Haskell, Javascript, Postscript, Prolog, R, Rust and HTML.
Please find below guest contributions.</description>

      <description>It has been wonderful journey so far in the year 2019. When I started the journey in March, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it would take this shape. All credit goes to the support of Perl/Raku community in general. It would be unfair if I pick few names. You know who I am talking about anyway. Let me share the story with you all.
I was working on 2 ideas at the start of the year 2019, &amp;ldquo;Perl Weekly Challenge&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;London Hack Day&amp;rdquo;.</description>
