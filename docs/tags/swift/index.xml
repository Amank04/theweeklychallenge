      <description>As you know, &amp;ldquo;Perl Weekly Challenge&amp;rdquo;, primarily focus on Perl and Raku. During the Week #018, we received the solution to &amp;ldquo;Perl Weekly Challenge - 018&amp;rdquo; by Orestis Zekai in Python. It was a pleasant surprise to receive solution in something other than Perl and Raku. Ever since regular team members also started contributing in other languages like APL, Awk, Bash, C, C++, Elm, Erlang, Go, Haskell, HTML, Idris, Java, Javascript, Lisp, Node, Postscript, Prolog, R, Ruby, Rust, Swift and Tcl.</description>

      <description>HEADLINE Happy Independence Day to all my fellow Indians This week tasks are once again fun and challenging. Keeping the balance is very difficult, I must admit.
 but I am trying &amp;hellip;
 For the first time, I have joined the private Early Bird Club and taking the advantage of doing the challenge before the launch. I am not sure, if you noticed, this I shared by solutions before lunch time on day one.</description>

      <description>HEADLINE No Linked List related task this week?
I am glad, this week focus was more Array/List related. Technical speaking Array and List aren&amp;rsquo;t the same in Perl. I must admit until I read the article by brian d foy, I thought they were the same. As the famous saying, you learn something new every day.
Both the tasks, this week were not terribly difficult. I noticed many members of Team PWC attempted other languages because they finished the tasks in no time.</description>
