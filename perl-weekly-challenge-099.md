## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

We are fast approaching the `100th week` of the weekly challenge.

Have you got any plan?

Any suggestion to make it a special?

Do you know any fun and challenging tasks that we have not done yet for the special week?

Last week, I asked for suggestion of Award names. So far, I have received two names `Witty Code Award` and `Warden of Code Award`.

Please do share your ideas as we still have `2 weeks` before the big event.

Did you notice, today is the first **Monday** of the month and time to announce the **Champion**?

Believe it or not, picking one name among so many is the most difficult task for me.

We are proud to declare `Stuart Little` as the first **Champion** of the year **2021**.

I request all **Perl** and **Raku** reviewers, current and past, please send your three nominations each for year **2019** and **2020**.

You should receive the formal email request soon in this regard.

I formally request all **Team PWC** members to nominate their favourite blogger for year **2019** and **2020**.

Let's welcome three new members to **Team PWC** i.e. [Jan Hoogenraad](https://github.com/jan-perl), [Robbie Hatley](https://github.com/LoneWolfiNTj) and [Kai Burgdorf](https://github.com/kaicb97).

Last but not least, I would like to thank `Dave Cross` for patching the content for website. Much appreciated.

## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If a big organisation came forward and supported us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Pattern Match {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a string `$S` and a pattern `$P`.

Write a script to check if given pattern validate the entire string. Print 1 if pass otherwise 0.

The patterns can also have the following characters:

###### ? - Match any single character.
###### * - Match any sequence of characters.

## Example 1:

    Input: $S = "abcde" $P = "a*e"
    Output: 1

## Example 2:

    Input: $S = "abcde" $P = "a*d"
    Output: 0

## Example 3:

    Input: $S = "abcde" $P = "?b*d"
    Output: 0

## Example 4:

    Input: $S = "abcde" $P = "a*c?e"
    Output: 1

<br>

***
## TASK #2 › Unique Subsequence {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given two strings `$S` and `$T`.

Write a script to find out count of different unique subsequences matching `$T` without changing the position of characters.

## Example 1:

    Input: $S = "littleit', $T = 'lit'
    Output: 4

        1: [lit] tleit
        2: [li] t [t] leit
        3: [li] ttlei [t]
        4: litt [l] e [it]

## Example 2:

    Input: $S = "london', $T = 'lon'
    Output: 3

        1: [lon] don
        2: [lo] ndo [n]
        3: [l] ond [on]
