## SPONSOR {#SPONSOR}
***

Our solo sponsor `Pete Sergeant` has been a great support to keep us motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank **Pete** and his entire team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become possible in 2021. The amount doesn't have to be huge. However, it would be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

## TASK #1 › Fun Time {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given a time (12 hour / 24 hour).

Write a script to convert the given time from 12 hour format to 24 hour format and vice versa.

Ideally we expect a one-liner.

## Example 1:

    Input: 05:15 pm or 05:15pm
    Output: 17:15

## Example 2:

    Input: 19:15
    Output: 07:15 pm or 07:15pm

<br>

## TASK #2 › Triangle Sum {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
***

You are given triangle array.

Write a script to find the minimum path sum from top to bottom.

When you are on index `i` on the current row then you may move to either index `i` or index `i + 1` on the next row.

## Example 1:

    Input: Triangle = [ [1], [2,4], [6,4,9], [5,1,7,2] ]
    Output: 8

    Explanation: The given triangle

                1
               2 4
              6 4 9
             5 1 7 2

    The minimum path sum from top to bottom:  1 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 8

                 [1]
               [2]  4
               6 [4] 9
              5 [1] 7 2

## Example 2:

    Input: Triangle = [ [3], [3,1], [5,2,3], [4,3,1,3] ]
    Output: 7

    Explanation: The given triangle

                3
               3 1
              5 2 3
             4 3 1 3

    The minimum path sum from top to bottom: 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7

                 [3]
                3  [1]
               5 [2] 3
              4 3 [1] 3
